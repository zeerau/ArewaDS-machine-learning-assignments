DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4Is), also named gliptins like sitagliptin, have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects; thereby lessen inflammatory and oxidative stress in diabetic Covid-19 patients. Therefore, the present study aimed to illustrate the potential beneficial effect of sitagliptin in managing Covid-19 in non-diabetic patients. METHODS A total number of 89 patients with Covid-19 were recruited from a single-center at the time of diagnosis. The recruited patients were assigned according to the standard therapy for Covid-19 and our interventional therapy into two groups; Group A: Covid-19 patients on the standard therapy (n=40) and Group B: Covid-19 patients on the standard therapy plus sitagliptin (n=49). The duration of this interventional study was 28 days according to the guideline in management patients with Covid-19. Routine laboratory investigations, serological tests, complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and serum ferritin were measured to observed Covid-19 severity and complications. Lung computed tomography (CT) and clinical scores were evaluated. RESULTS The present study illustrated that sitagliptin add-on standard therapy improved clinical outcomes, radiological scores, and inflammatory biomarkers than standard therapy alone in non-diabetic patients with Covid-19 (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Sitagliptin add-on standard therapy in managing non-diabetic Covid-19 patients may have a robust beneficial effect by modulating inflammatory cytokines with subsequent good clinical outcomes.",2021-09-01,"Al-Kuraishy, Hayder M; Al-Gareeb, Ali I; Qusty, Naeem; Alexiou, Athanasios; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber",Current molecular pharmacology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2174/1874467214666210902115650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34477540/,237399283.0
qa5n3xpi,,WHO,Utilizing Health Behavior Change and Technology Acceptance Models to Predict the Adoption of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps: Cross-sectional Survey Study,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: To combat the global COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing apps have been discussed as digital health solutions to track infection chains and provide appropriate information. However, observational studies point to low acceptance in most countries, and few studies have yet examined theory-based predictors of app use in the general population to guide health communication efforts. OBJECTIVE: This study utilizes established health behavior change and technology acceptance models to predict adoption intentions and frequency of current app use. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey between May and July 2020 in a German convenience sample (N=349; mean age 35.62 years; n=226, 65.3% female). To inspect the incremental validity of model constructs as well as additional variables (privacy concerns, personalization), hierarchical regression models were applied, controlling for covariates. RESULTS: The theory of planned behavior and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology predicted adoption intentions (R2=56%-63%) and frequency of current app use (R2=33%-37%). A combined model only marginally increased the predictive value by about 5%, but lower privacy concerns and higher threat appraisals (ie, anticipatory anxiety) significantly predicted app use when included as additional variables. Moreover, the impact of perceived usefulness was positive for adoption intentions but negative for frequency of current app use. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several theory-based predictors of contact tracing app use. However, few constructs, such as social norms, have a consistent positive effect across models and outcomes. Further research is required to replicate these observations, and to examine the interconnectedness of these constructs and their impact throughout the pandemic. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that promulgating affirmative social norms and positive emotional effects of app use, as well as addressing health concerns, might be promising strategies to foster adoption intentions and app use in the general population.",2021,"Tomczyk, Samuel; Barth, Simon; Schmidt, Silke; Muehlan, Holger",J Med Internet Res,,#covidwho-1259297,,,,,233351148.0

Although not yet approved for pediatric use by Health Canada, it has been occasionally offered by asthma specialists as a therapeutic trial in children with troublesome asthma or treatment for adverse effects. The objective of this study was to describe the indications and real-life clinical experience in initiating tiotropium in children with asthma. METHODS: We designed a retrospective mixed-method case series study of children aged 1–17 years who initiated tiotropium in our tertiary-care centre between 2013 and 2020. Clinical information was extracted from electronic medical records and tiotropium dispensing, from drug claims. Parents/children and physicians independently completed a questionnaire about treatment goals, perceived efficacy, safety, satisfaction, and lessons learned. RESULTS: The 34 (11 females; 23 males) children had a median (range) age of 9.1 (1.4–17.8) years. Children were primarily on Step 4 (85%) or 5 (6%) prior to tiotropium initiation, yet most (84%) did not increase their treatment step after tiotropium initiation. The physicians’ treatment goals were to improve asthma control, alleviate adverse effects of current therapy, and/or improve lung function. The most improved symptoms were coughing/moist cough, difficulty breathing, whistling breath, and bronchial secretions/mucus. Although most parents and physicians reported a significant benefit with tiotropium bromide, physicians particularly remarked, as their “lesson learned’, on the improvement in chronic symptoms in asthmatic children, particularly those with prominent moist cough and in lung function, in those with seemingly none (or incompletely) reversible obstruction as well as the ability to decrease the ICS and/or LABA dose to lessen adverse effects. A few physicians raised caution on the risk of lower adherence with an additional inhaler. CONCLUSION: In children with severe asthma on Step 4 or 5, tiotropium bromide was primarily used as substitute, rather than additional, adjunct therapy to improve asthma control, alleviate adverse effects, and/or to improve lung function. The latter two indications, combined with its perceived effectiveness in children with prominent moist cough, also suggest additional indications of tiotropium to be formally explored.",2021-12-12,"Ridha, Zainab; Bédard, Marc-Antoine; Smyrnova, Anna; Drouin, Olivier; Pruteanu, Aniela; Essouri, Sandrine; Ducharme, Francine M.",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4d4a64f98aac069dd375c8a82d84808fcd7493d8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8666101.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13223-021-00632-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34895321/,245118970.0

The aim was to assess concentrations of chemerin, omentin, and vaspin among COVID-19 patients with an emphasis on adipokines relationship with COVID-19 severity, concomitant metabolic abnormalities and liver dysfunction. Serum chemerin, omentin and vaspin concentrations were measured in serum collected from 70 COVID-19 patients at the moment of admission to hospital, before any treatment was applied and 20 healthy controls. Serum chemerin and omentin concentrations were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy volunteers (271.0 vs. 373.0 ng/ml; p < 0.001 and 482.1 vs. 814.3 ng/ml; p = 0.01, respectively). There were no correlations of analyzed adipokines with COVID-19 severity based on the presence of pneumonia, dyspnea, or necessity of Intensive Care Unit hospitalization (ICU). Liver test abnormalities did not influence adipokines levels. Elevated GGT activity was associated with ICU admission, presence of pneumonia and elevated concentrations of CRP, ferritin and interleukin 6. Chemerin and omentin depletion in COVID-19 patients suggests that this adipokines deficiency play influential role in disease pathogenesis. However, there was no relationship between lower adipokines level and frequency of COVID-19 symptoms as well as disease severity.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey among young adults with T1DM (aged 18-30 years) in the North, Central, South and West zones of India. It consisted of fifteen, five and eight questions pertaining to knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19, respectively. Certain questions relevant to T1DM were also incorporated. RESULTS: After exclusion, 212 participants were included (mean age=25.1±4.3 years; M:F=10:11). The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 83% (mean total knowledge score=12.4±1.9). Most (74%) had average knowledge score (mean±1SD).

xeq9a21a,,WHO,Need for ensuring care for neuro-emergencies-lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: To investigate whether patients with critical emergency conditions are seeking or receiving the medical care that they require, we characterized the reality of care for patients presenting with neuro-emergencies during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this observational, longitudinal cohort study, all neurosurgical admissions that presented to our department between February 1 and April 15 during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the same time period in 2019 were identified and categorized according to the presence of a neuro-emergency, the route of admission, management, and the category of disease. Further, the clinical course of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) was investigated representatively for severe vascular and semi-urgent traumatic conditions that present with a wide variety of symptoms. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the percentage of neuro-emergencies among all neurosurgical admissions remained similar but a larger proportion presented through the emergency department than through the outpatient clinic or by referral (*p = 0.009). The total number of neuro-emergencies was significantly reduced (*p = 0.0007) across all types of disease, particularly in vascular (*p = 0.036) but also in spinal (*p = 0.007) and hydrocephalus (*p = 0.048) emergencies. Patients with spinal emergencies presented 48 h later (*p = 0.001) despite comparable symptom severity. For aSAH, the number of cases, aSAH grade, aneurysm localization, and treatment modality did not change but strikingly, elderly patients with cSDH presented less frequently, with more severe symptoms (*p = 0.046), and were less likely to reach favorable outcome (*p = 0.003) at discharge compared with previous years. CONCLUSIONS: Despite pandemic-related restrictive measures and reallocation of resources, patients with neuro-emergencies should be encouraged to present regardless of the severity of symptoms because deferred presentation may result in adverse outcome.

METHODS: This study included 104 participants, &#8805;18 years old who were previous patients of family health clinics for a variety of reasons in the months preceding the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence was administered to these patients as part of their initial intakes. The participants were asked to complete a questionnaire related to socio-demographic information and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence after obtaining agreement to participate during the pandemic period. In addition, written informed consent was obtained. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20, was used to analyse the acquired data. RESULTS: The participants were 48.1% and 51.9% women and men, respectively. The pre-pandemic and Covid-19 pandemic mean smoking addiction scores were 5.03 and 5.6, respectively. The smoking addiction levels before and during the Covid-19 pandemic significantly differed (P < .001). Of the individuals with low smoking addiction levels before the pandemic, 17.6% and 29.4% became moderately and highly addicted, respectively. Of the individuals with moderate smoking addiction level, 6.3% and 43.9% became lowly and highly addicted, respectively. CONCLUSION: The smoking addiction level may change based on various factors including behavioural changes. While increases in smoking addiction during the pandemic can be observed caused by behavioural changes and anxieties that may arise because of the pandemic, a decrease in addiction levels and even smoking cessation can also be observed during these times because of the more progressive course of Covid-19 in smokers.

Functional MR in chronic HFrEF reflects primarily the severity of LV dysfunction and is not related to structural alterations of the mitral valvular apparatus. FMR in patients with HFrEF independently of the etiology of HFrEF and its underlying mechanisms, contributes to progression of the symptoms of HF and is independent predictor of worse clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the severity of functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) and its clinical implications in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). METHODS: We enrolled 146 consecutive adult patients with CHF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who presented to outpatient clinics. All patients underwent clinical and physical examination. Baseline examination included medical history, detailed assessment of current medication, electrocardiogram recording, transthoracic echocardiogram and comorbidities. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction was defined in line with the new guidelines as history of HF signs and symptoms as well as a LV ejection fraction (LVEF) below 40%. Cardiovascular risk factors were recorded according to the respective guidelines. FMR was defined and graded according to the ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease. The extent of FMR was assessed at baseline and after a median follow-up period of 4 years in 146 consecutive HFrEF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction <40%). All of the patients received the heart failure (HF) medications in agreement with 2016 and 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. Major adverse cardiac events were defined as a composite of all-cause death and the need for admission for HF. RESULTS: A total of 146 chronic HFrEF patients (mean age of 63±11 years, 62% male, mean LVEF of 25±11%) of which 19% patients had severe FMR at baseline, with a mean EROA of 31.4±2.7 mm2 and a mean Reg Vol of 45.9±5.3 ml. There was a significant interaction between FMR and NYHA functional class in predicting death or need for hospitalization, (P < 0.0001 for the interaction term FMR NYHA III-IV). During a median follow-up period of 4.2 (IQR) 3.1-5.8) years, the primary endpoint occurred in 52 (36%) patients (21 HF admissions, and 31 deaths). There was a strong graded association between the presence and degree of FMR and risk of death or admission (P <0.0001) at 4 years follow-up period. Regarding HF therapy, 129 patients (88%) received RAAS antagonists, 17 patients (12%) received ARNI, 86 patients (59%) received beta-blockers, 75 patients (51%) were treated with MRA. 31 patients (21%) underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with a response rate of 64%. 24 patients (16%) underwent ICD implantation. CONCLUSION: Guideline-directed medical therapy is the first-line treatment for chronic HF patients who also have FMR.

6x0f11qj,,WHO,Behavioral decision making for sustainable development,,,,unk,"Human decisions are simultaneously determined by economic incentives and psychological motivations. Based upon this fundamental assumption, I compose three interdisciplinary studies which analyze individual, collective and government actions at multiple levels of aggregation, and how they in turn lead to various economic and psychological outcomes. In the first study, I explore the key predictors of the level of compliance to social distancing and mask wearing in the United states by aggregating interdisciplinary datasets and applying multi-level analysis. I use a behavioral model to classify the determinants of compliance to COVID-19 response measures into economic incentives and psychological motivations and show that the former would have an increasing marginal effect on working hours. Empirically, I show that (a) economic vulnerability was the key predictor of failure of social distancing in 2020, even taking partisanship into account. (b) mask wearing was more politicized than social distancing, and in Fall (close to the elections), Republican partisanship was the only dominant indicator of noncompliance of mask wearing. In the second study, we use a coordination game model to discuss the dynamics of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) on COVID-19 in the United States. We use a theoretical model to justify that there exist social reinforcement effects between policies in US states, i.e. the implementation of an NPI in a state would increase the possibility that others follow suit. Under certain conditions, if enough states engage in NPIs, they will tip others that have not yet done so to follow suit and thus shift the Nash equilibrium to the greatest one (all states follow). Then, we show that there can be equilibria where states with different political leanings adopt different strategies when politics is a determinant of the interaction intensity. Empirically, we use a random utility model (RUM) to test it in reality with Probit and Logit regressions, and find robust evidence that inter-state social reinforcement is important and that equilibria can be tipped in mask wearing, and slightly weaker confirmation for social distancing. In the last study, I explore how personality traits in China are different from the traditional Five-Factor model by a large twin dataset in Yunnan Province. I find robust evidence about personality structures, formation and impacts in China and state three findings: (1) Personality traits in China seem to have a significance deviation from the well-accepted Five Factor Model. Instead, it has two general factors, relying on whether the item is positive or negative in tone. Positive factors include Social Desirability, Extraversion and Openness;negative factors include Disorderliness, Neuroticism and Introversion. (2) The genetic heritability of personality traits in China is significantly lower than that measured in the Western countries. For some traits, such as Social Desirability and Disorderliness, the genetic effect is around 0 and the shared environmental effect is much larger. This challenges previous findings in the West. (3) Using a within-twin fixed effect model, we find suggestive evidence on the causal effect on economic preferences and outcomes, including education performance, income, risk attitudes and subjective well-being.These three studies use the similar behavioral science methodology to study different levels of decision making, and all have important implications for issues of sustainable development.

METHODS: The study period was limited to the first 6 months of the pandemic and aimed to explore the responses by public health authorities, media, general population, and law makers during the initial phase of pandemic. RESULTS: Social disparity, underfunded pandemic preparation, and the initial failure to act appropriately have resulted in the rapid spread of infection in both countries. In the United States, prevailing social inequalities and racism, inaccessible health care, higher rates of preexisting medical conditions and disputed political leadership have further deteriorated the situation and enhanced public suffering, particularly for the black and Indigenous communities. In Canada, its poorly regulated services of long‐term care facilities, initial restriction of testing and lack of access to epidemiological data have helped spread the infection and increased casualties in vulnerable populations.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and factors affecting the mortality in patients with COVID-19. Material and Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in EDICU. Patients were divided into mortality and survival groups, and the clinical characteristics of these groups were compared. Results: A total of 38 patients were included;47.4% (n = 18) were in the survival group. Oxygen saturation level was significantly different between the mortality and survival groups [78.0% (63.7-83.0) vs 88.5% (81.5-93.2), p = 0.001). Patients in the mortality group had higher plasma levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate, ferritin and D-dimer. Univariate regression analysis showed that oxygen saturation, LDH, CRP and endotracheal intubation (ETI) were significant markers in predicting mortality (p = 0.011, p = 0.035, p <0.001, respectively). A CRP level >= 91.9 mg/L predicts mortality with a sensitivity of 66.6% and a specificity of 80.0% (AUC: 0.781, 95% CI: 0.617- 0,898). Discussion: This study showed that oxygen saturation, ETI, LDH and CRP levels were significantly successful in predicting mortality.

Prior work tied increased child recreational screen time and decreased parent mental health specifically to school and daycare closures (rather than work-at-home policies, unemployment, fluctuating COVID rates, etc.). However, losses are different from gains, and just because losing childcare hurts families does not mean increasing childcare will help them. We use the fact that schools reopened at different times and to different degrees across the country, showing that return to in-person schooling decreased child recreational screen time and improved parent mental health.

Before the COVID -19 pandemic tele-rheumatology was proposed to patients living in remote areas. Currently, the use of telemedicine has increased significantly. We report on the implementation of a telemedicine program for the evaluation and treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases (1). Objectives: The aim of the study is to evaluate telemedicine as a viable approach for routine follow-up and management of rheumatic disease. Methods: Sixty-six patients were evaluated online by the remote rheumatologist in four weeks. The population of rheumatology patients was evaluated using a IARPLUS platform Information collected included demographic information consisting of age, gender, and primary rheumatologic diagnosis. Results: The average age of patients who were seen was 54 years and 85% of patients were women. The most common disorders included rheumatoid arthritis (22, 33%), axial spondyloarthropathies (7, 11%), and psoriatic arthritis (15,23%), systemic sclerosis (13, 20%), lupus (6, 9%), UCTD (2,3%), Sjogren and fibromyalgia (1, 1.5%). Results: All patients were given recommendations on COVID-19 vaccine administration. Therapy was remodeled in 13 patients (in particular in 5 patients with anemia intravenous iron infusion was scheduled;1 started immunosuppressant therapy for proteinuria, 4 increased methotrexate for disease activity, 2 discontinued Methotrexate for adverse events (hypertransaminasemia), 1 suspended OH-chloroquine due to retinal accumulation;2 biologic-naive patients, after a three-month of waiting due to inability to come to the hospital, started the biologic drug;22 patients received a renewal of the therapeutic plan;25 patients had a regular six-month follow up;2 ticket exemption for illness;13 consultations and/ or laboratory tests (1 pneumological consultation, 1 ophthalmological consultation, 1 request for sacro-iliac MRI, 3 nailfold videocapillaroscopies, 3 FKT, 1 musculotendinous ultrasound, 1 antibodies for celiac disease, 2 antibodies anti Sars-CoV-2).

Strategies involving the isolation of close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. Methods We fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary schools to both community swab testing data and secondary school absences data. By simulating epidemics in secondary schools from 31st August 2020 until 21st May 2021, we quantify within-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in secondary schools in England, the impact of twice weekly mass testing on within-school transmission, and the potential impact of alternative strategies to the isolation of close contacts in reducing pupil absences. Findings The within-school reproduction number, R school , has remained below 1 from 31st August 2020 until 21st May 2021. Twice weekly mass testing using LFTs have helped to control within-school transmission in secondary schools in England. A strategy of serial contact testing alongside mass testing substantially reduces absences compared to strategies involving isolating close contacts, with only a marginal increase in within-school transmission. Interpretation Secondary school control strategies involving mass testing have the potential to control within-school transmission while substantially reducing absences compared to an isolation of close contacts policy.",2021-07-16,"Leng, T.; Hill, E.

SeMet is synthesized in plants and some fungi and, via nutrition, finds its way into mammalian cells. In contrast to its sulfur analog methionine (Met), SeMet is extraordinarily redox active under physiological conditions and via its catalytic selenide (RSeR’)/selenoxide (RSe(O)R’) couple provides protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other possibly harmful oxidants. In contrast to SeCys, which is incorporated via an eloquent ribosomal mechanism, SeMet can enter such biomolecules by simply replacing proteinogenic Met. Interestingly, eukaryotes, such as yeast and mammals, also metabolize SeMet to a small family of reactive selenium species (RSeS). Together, SeMet, proteins containing SeMet and metabolites of SeMet form a powerful triad of redox-active metabolites with a plethora of biological implications.

It finds that the EU-Ukraine “deep” trade agenda is marked by medium effectiveness, with the strongest concerns, attributed to corruption, weak rule of law and strong oligarchic influence. At the same time, the DCFTA had been a strong engine for trade-related reforms (e.g. countering technical barriers to trade; public procurement; competition and state aid) in Ukraine over the period from 2014 to 2019. Yet, the reforms’ tempo slowed down after the most recent presidential elections, with numerous changes pending in the domains of transport and infrastructure, financial sector reform and customs reforms.

Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-8, and IL-6, play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS by stimulating chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils. To obtain further insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-associated ALI, we compared SARS-CoV infections in two different nonhuman primate species, cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys. Viral titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract were not significantly different in SARS-CoV-infected macaques and African green monkeys. Inflammatory cytokines that play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS or have neutrophil chemoattractant activity, such as IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CXCL2, were, however, induced only in macaques. In contrast, other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including osteopontin and CCL3, were upregulated in the lungs of African green monkeys to a significantly greater extent than in macaques. Because African green monkeys developed more severe ALI than macaques, with hyaline membrane formation, some of these differentially expressed proinflammatory genes may be critically involved in development of the observed pathological changes.

OBJECTIVES: In this review, we have focused on an alternative therapeutic approach using natural products utilizing host anti-viral responses for resolving COVID-19 pathogenesis. METHODS: We have searched databases like PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for articles related to natural products and viral diseases, with a specific focus on coronaviruses, as well as other RNA viruses and recent updates on COVID-19 pandemic, and collected articles and reviewed comprehensively. RESULTS: Scientific studies clarified the viral pathogenesis that involved viral entrance into host cells, and antiviral response inside the cells, which can be effectively targeted by numerous natural compounds from different sources. Many of these compounds can potentially target viral genomic material or protein machinery. Natural products which were found effective against other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (which emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively) might be effective against SARS-CoV-2 due to their structural similarities; however, it needs time to establish the clinical success of these drugs.

METHODS: In this prospective study, disease activity and clinical assessments were recorded from the first dose of vaccine until day 15 after the second dose in 126 patients with SLE. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were measured against wild-type spike antigen, while serum-neutralising activity was assessed against the SARS-CoV-2 historical strain and variants of concerns (VOCs). Vaccine-specific T cell responses were quantified by interferon-γ release assay after the second dose. RESULTS: BNT162b2 was well tolerated and no statistically significant variations of BILAG (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group) and SLEDAI (SLE Disease Activity Index) scores were observed throughout the study in patients with SLE with active and inactive disease at baseline. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and methotrexate (MTX) treatments were associated with drastically reduced BNT162b2 antibody response (β=−78, p=0.007; β=−122, p<0.001, respectively). Anti-spike antibody response was positively associated with baseline total immunoglobulin G serum levels, naïve B cell frequencies (β=2, p=0.018; β=2.5, p=0.003) and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response (r=0.462, p=0.003). In responders, serum neutralisation activity decreased against VOCs bearing the E484K mutation but remained detectable in a majority of patients.

To allow the public to be aware of the exposure risks in their daily activities, we proposed a birthday-paradox-based probability model and implement it into a web-based system named COSRE for estimating community exposure risks of public gathering during a pandemic. The exposure risk means the probability of people meeting potential COVID hosts in public places like grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, office suits, etc. The model has three inputs: the real-time potential active patients, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the room. With COSRE, people can explore the possible impacts of the pandemic by doing spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., moving through time and testing a different number of people to see the changes of risks as the pandemic unfolds. The system has the potential to advance our ability to know the accurate exposure risks in various communities and allow us to make plans with improved preparedness and precise responses for the pandemic. We use spatial analysis tools and drew the county-level exposure risks of the United States from April 1 to May 15.

In spite of the stringent measures adopted by affected countries, rising number of healthcare workers (HCWs) are getting infected, dwindling the scarce manpower at our disposal. In the pre-COVID-19 times, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was offered unhesitantly to all patients, who had even a slim chance of achieving return of spontaneous circulation. In COVID-19 era, CPR, due to some components being high aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), has become high-risk procedure for the HCWs. Instead of “Primum non nocere” (first do no harm), we are forced to change to “Primum non nocere ad te” (first do no harm to yourself). The challenge is therefore to provide best possible chance of survival to deserving patients, whose COVID-19 status might be unknown, without causing harm to the HCWs. In this review, we discuss the current data regarding infected HCWs, outcomes of inhospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, components of CPR which are high-risk AGPs, how to safeguard the HCWs while offering CPR, and the ethical considerations when CPR is considered, in this COVID-19 era. We wish to emphasize here that there is NO EMERGENCY in a pandemic, and time must be made for donning appropriate PPE.

Nevertheless, the assessment of clinical performances of available tests is urgently required as their use has just been initiated for diagnose. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of three immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: Two automated immunoassays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgG and Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG/IgA assays) and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA NG-Test® IgG-IgM COVID-19) were tested. 293 specimens were analyzed from patients with a positive RT-PCR response, from patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 but exhibiting a negative response to the RT-PCR detection test, and from control group specimens. Days since symptoms onset were collected from clinical information sheet associated with respiratory tract samples. RESULTS: Overall sensitivity for IgG was equivalent (around 80 %) for CLIA, ELISA and LFIA. Sensitivity for IgG detection, >14 days after onset of symptoms, was 100.0 % for all assays. Overall specificity for IgG was greater for CLIA and LFIA (more than 98 %) compared to ELISA (95.8 %).

Specialist services, including clinical genetics, must consider methods of remote delivery including videoconferencing-termed telegenetics. This review evaluates the evidence for telegenetics and its applicability to future service development. METHODS: A systematic review of six databases was conducted to identify studies from 2005 onward using synchronous videoconferencing to deliver clinical genetics services. Included studies compared telegenetics to an alternative method or used a before and after design. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria (eight compared telegenetics to in-person consultations and three to telephone delivery). Patient satisfaction, genetic knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes were similar for in-person and telegenetic counseling. There was some evidence that telegenetics may be superior to telephone delivery for knowledge gain and reduction in anxiety and depression. There is limited evidence concerning the effect of telegenetics on provider satisfaction and behavioral outcomes. Conclusions are limited by at least moderate risk of bias in all evaluated studies and small sample sizes.

OBJECTIVES To examine fungal and bacterial growth on cleaned reusable lead wires, determine if microbial growth is associated with hospital site or work environment, determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and learn if antibiotic-resistant bacteria are associated with hospital site and work environment. METHODS Cleaned lead wires (N = 320) from critical care and telemetry units, emergency departments, and operating rooms of 4 hospitals were swabbed and the specimens cultured for microbial growth. Bacterial species were grouped by their risk for human infection: at risk (n = 9), potential risk (n = 5), and no risk (n = 10). Work environments were compared by using pairwise contrasts from a generalized estimating equation model. RESULTS Fungi were rare (0.6%). Of 226 cultures from 201 wires (62.8%) with bacterial growth, 121 were of at- or potential-risk bacteria (37.8%).

The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the perceptions of healthcare workers (HCWs) and the general population regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, (2) to evaluate factors influencing the acceptance of vaccination using the health belief model (HBM), and (3) to qualitatively explore the suggested intervention strategies to promote the vaccination. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on electronic survey data that was collected in Iraq during December first-19th, 2020. The electronic survey was designed using Qualtrics. HBM was followed to develop the survey items. A regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing people accepting vaccination. Thematic analysis for participant comments to an open-ended question. RESULTS: A total of 1680 completed surveys were received. The mean age of 31.2 ± 9.9 years, 53.0% were female and 47.0% were male. The largest group was HCWs (45.7%), followed by general population (37.5%) and health college students (16.8%). Our findings expressed some hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine with the acceptance rate of 61.7%. The HCWs perceived significantly higher susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. The HCWs were significantly more likely than the general population to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Concerns with proper storage was the biggest barrier to vaccine receipt. The regression analysis indicated eight factors that were significantly associated with the willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine: Preventive measures, perceived benefit, perceived barriers, cue to action, subjective norm, supportive of vaccination in general and having received a flu vaccine before. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness campaign can focus on enhancing the vaccine perceived benefit, debunking misconceptions, and increasing the disease perceived severity. Additionally, the public health leaders need to minimize the perceived barriers by providing the vaccines and appeasing people concerns about their storage, effectiveness, and adverse events.",2021,"Al-Metwali, Basma Zuheir; Al-Jumaili, Ali Azeez; Al-Alag, Zahraa Adel; Sorofman, Bernard",J. eval. clin. pract.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether telephone-based reality orientation therapy (T-ROT) can improve cognition, mood, and neuropsychiatric symptoms among patients with major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) who are forced to isolate and also whether T-ROT can relieve the burden of distress among their caregivers. DESIGN Nonrandomized interventional comparison study. SETTING Individual telephone calls between practitioners and patients and their caregivers. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-seven patients (14 in the experimental group, 13 in the control group) with a major NCD and their primary caregivers. INTERVENTION Ten T-ROT sessions and a pretest-posttest neuropsychological evaluation over 4 wk. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes measured included cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with major NCDs and correlations between changes in patient clinical condition and caregiver stress. Primary outcome measures were two measures of depressive symptoms, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and the Telephone Mini-Mental State Examination, administered at baseline and program discharge. RESULTS T-ROT significantly outperformed nontreatment on all measures of depression, behavior, cognition, and caregiver burden.

Postexposure onset of dietary restriction (DR) is expected to provide therapeutic nutritional approaches to reduce health risk from exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) due to such as manned space exploration, radiotherapy, or nuclear accidents as IR could alleviate radiocarcinogenesis in animal models. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study is aimed at investigating the effect from postexposure onset of DR on genotoxicity and genomic instability (GI) induced by total body irradiation (TBI) in mice. Materials and Methods. Mice were exposed to 2.0 Gy of accelerated iron particles with an initial energy of 500 MeV/nucleon and a linear energy transfer (LET) value of about 200 keV/μm. After TBI, mice were either allowed to free access to a standard laboratory chow or treated under DR (25% cut in diet). Using micronucleus frequency (MNF) in bone marrow erythrocytes, induction of acute genotoxicity and GI in the hematopoietic system was, respectively, determined 1 and 2 months after TBI. Results and Conclusions. TBI alone caused a significant increase in MNF while DR alone did not markedly influence the MNF. DR induced a significant decrease in MNF compared to the treatment by TBI alone. Results demonstrated that postexposure onset of DR could relieve the elevated MNF induced by TBI with high-LET iron particles. These findings indicated that reduction in acute genotoxicity and late GI may be at least a part of the mechanisms underlying decreased radiocarcinogenesis by DR.",2021-11-25,"Wang, Bing; Katsube, Takanori; Tanaka, Kaoru; Murakami, Masahiro; Nenoi, Mitsuru",Biomed Res Int,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7986443524c5d58a6676e44a73592423fe8ce144.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8677402.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8677402/,

In the majority of cases, the indication for adenotonsillectomy in young children is obstructive breathing. Preoperative evaluation for patient comorbidities, especially obstructive sleep apnea, risk factors for a difficult airway, and history of recent illness are crucial to prepare the patient for surgery and develop an anesthetic plan. Communication and collaboration with the otolaryngologist is key to prevent and treat intraoperative events such as airway fires or hemorrhage.

Appropriate diagnosis reaching the sub- and pathotype level is the basis of combatting notifiable AIV infections. Real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) has become a standard diagnostic tool. Here, a total of 24 arrayed RT-qPCRs is introduced for full subtyping of 16 hemagglutinin and nine neuraminidase subtypes of AIV. This array, designated Riems Influenza A Typing Array version 2 (RITA-2), represents an updated and economized version of the RITA-1 array previously published by Hoffmann et al. RITA-2 provides improved integration of assays (24 instead of 32 parallel reactions) and reduced assay volume (12.5 µL). The technique also adds RT-qPCRs to detect Newcastle Disease (NDV) and Infectious Bronchitis viruses (IBV). In addition, it maximizes inclusivity (all sequences within one subtype) and exclusivity (no intersubtypic cross-reactions) as shown in validation runs using a panel of 428 AIV reference isolates, 15 reference samples each of NDV and IBV, and 122 clinical samples. The open format of RITA-2 is particularly tailored to subtyping influenza A virus of avian hosts and Eurasian geographic origin.

Food wastage triggers unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation or loss of biodiversity. This study aims to quantify the water-related benefits associated with food loss and waste reduction by studying the Food Bank of Navarra (FBN). For this purpose, the water footprint assessment manual has been followed. First, the water footprint of the activities of the FBN has been analysed for the year 2018 (scenario with the FBN). A comparative analysis has been carried out between the scenario with the FBN and a theoretical scenario without the action of the FBN. This has allowed us to highlight the benefits associated with the activity of this entity. The FBN not only avoided the waste of 2.7 thousand tons of food suitable for consumption in 2018, but also avoided the unnecessary use of more than 3.2 million m(3) of freshwater.

Superspreaders represent a group of people who have much more social contacts than others. The widespread deployment of WLAN infrastructure enables non-invasive contact tracing via people’s ubiquitous mobile devices. This technology offers promise for detecting superspreaders. In this paper, we propose a general framework for WLAN-log-based superspreader detection. In our framework, we first use WLAN logs to construct contact graphs by jointly considering human symmetric and asymmetric interactions. Next, we adopt three vertex centrality measurements over the contact graphs to generate three groups of superspreader candidates. Finally, we leverage SEIR simulation to determine groups of superspreaders among these candidates, who are the most critical individuals for the spread of disease based on the simulation results. We have implemented our framework and evaluate it over a WLAN dataset with 41 million log entries from a large-scale university. Our evaluation shows superspreaders exist on university campuses. They change over the first few weeks of a semester, but stabilize throughout the rest of the term. The data also demonstrate that both symmetric and asymmetric contact tracing can discover superspreaders, but the latter performs better with daily contact graphs. Further, the evaluation shows no consistent differences among three vertex centrality measures for long-term (i.e., weekly) contact graphs, which necessitates the inclusion of SEIR simulation in our framework.

In the last 6 months, SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of reported cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. As other world regions, South America has not contained the pandemic's advance since it lacks the hospital and economic capacities. Public health implications of transmission, while the asymptomatic/presymptomatic infection is a critical concern at the current pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Describe the socio-demographic, clinical, and viral features of a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from the Colombian Caribbean. METHODS: Six hundred eighty-six clinical samples of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection cases and contacts individuals from several hospital centers in the department of Córdoba, Colombia, were received at our laboratory between April 9th and May 16th, 2020. RNA was extracted using lysis buffers and spin columns. The samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using commercially available multiplex real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of 3 target genes of SARS-CoV-2 (Allplex&#8482;, 2019-nCoV assay, Korea). Viral copies quantification was done using a standard curve constructed from seriated dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 positive control. Statics descriptive methods were used. RESULTS: Thirty-five nasopharyngeal samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; the average age was 43 (range, 1-95 years). Seventeen of 35 (49%) of the patients showed symptoms. Most of them had a cough, fever, and odynophagia; three of the patients reported having arthralgia. Only two patients required hospitalization. None of the patients had known co-morbidities. RT-qPCR results show that two of the symptomatic patients had significantly higher RNA copies than the rest. Eighteen of 35 (51%) individuals were asymptomatic, and the average age was 30 (range, 6-61 years). Four asymptomatic individuals showed a higher copy than some symptomatic patients; nonetheless, the average of RNA copies 8.26 × 1010 was lower than the symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that asymptomatic patients may develop infections with a high number of RNA copies. Since a considerable percentage of infections may be asymptomatic/presymptomatic, enhanced testing approaches may be needed to detect these persons. Due the occurrence of a large proportion of infections being a result from transmission originated in asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals, public health interventions in Colombia should be based on two steps: a massive molecular screening, and viral load quantification. Finally, a remarkable issue in our study is the average age of symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (43 and 30 respectively) which may be important because of the economic impact that has been caused by the coronavirus pandemic and may be probably the cause of the reduced lethality observed in the country and the department at the time of this study.",2020,"Mattar, Salim; Martinez-Bravo, Caty; Rivero, Ricardo; Contreras, Héctor; Faccini-Martínez, Álvaro A; Guzman-Teran, Camilo; Galeano, Ketty; Alvis-Guzman, Nelson; Contreras, Verónica; Arrieta, German; Gonzalez-Tous, Marco; Miranda, Jorge; Ospina, Martha; Camargo-Assis, Francisco; Mercado-Reyes, Marcela; Garay, Evelyn; Garcia-Perez, Alejandra; Lopez, Yesica; Tique, Vaneza",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,,#962728,,,,,227330568.0

This study examined the organization of IPF care across Australia, how it aligns with guidance for best practice, and identified barriers and facilitators to best care. METHODS Data on the organization of IPF care in Australia were collected from public hospitals using a study-specific questionnaire between February and July 2020. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with respiratory physicians from around Australia between April and December 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS Almost all hospitals (n = 38, 97%) held multidisciplinary meetings (MDMs) for diagnosing IPF, with 90% of multidisciplinary teams including expert respiratory physicians and radiologists; however, rheumatologists, interstitial lung disease nurses and a histopathologist were often not available. More than 90% of institutions had access to oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation and advanced care planning, but access to psychological support and clinical trials was limited (53% and 58%, respectively). Fifteen respiratory physicians (27% regional) were interviewed. Approaches to diagnosis, treatment and access to referral services were generally consistent with best practice guidance; however, regional respondents reported barriers related to inadequate staffing, lack of a nurse coordinator, inadequate access to clinical trials and funding models. Telehealth technologies were perceived as facilitators to best care.

Here, we combine RNA-sequencing, ribosome profiling and metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA, to comprehensively define the mechanisms that are utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to shutoff cellular protein synthesis. We show that infection leads to a global reduction in translation, but viral transcripts are not preferentially translated. Instead, we find that infection leads to accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs which facilitates viral takeover of the mRNA pool in infected cells. Moreover, we reveal that the translation of transcripts whose expression is induced in response to infection, including innate immune genes, is impaired.

Disparities could be due to neighborhoods with more adverse health outcomes associated with poverty and other social determinants of health experiencing higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to greater morbidity and mortality resulting from equivalent SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence. We surveyed five pairs of adjacent ZIP codes in Chicago with disparate COVID-19 case rates for highly specific and quantitative serological evidence of any prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 to compare with their disparate COVID-19 case rates. Dried blood spot samples were self-collected at home by internet-recruited participants in summer 2020, shortly after Chicago's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pairs of neighboring ZIP codes with very different COVID-19 case rates had similar seropositivity rates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG antibodies.

The several weeks pandemic of the COVID-19 disease has forced the healthcare systems of numerous countries to adjust their resources to the care of the growing number of COVID-19 patients. Managers were presented with the challenge of protecting the healthcare workers from transmission of the disease within medical institutions, and issues concerning the physical and psychological depletion of personnel. MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on analyses of the structure and work processes in Central Clinical Hospital (CCH) reconstructive strategic plan was developed. It included: division of existing wards into observation and isolation wards; installing locks; weekly plan for supplying personal protection equipment (PPE); designating new access to the hospital and communication routes; training of medical and supporting staff. The plan was implemented from the first days of conversion of the hospital. RESULTS The wards of the CCH were converted for observation and isolation, and each one was fitted with sanitary locks. There was a big improvement in the supply of PPE for the medical staff. Separation of the 'dirty' and 'clean' parts of the CCH were attained, and widespread intensive training not only protected personnel against infections, but also diminished unrest which was discernable at the beginning of conversion. CONCLUSIONS The transformation efforts will ultimately be appraised at the end of the epidemic, but the data looks encouraging. Two weeks after conversion, the testing of hospital Staff was started and by the end of April, 459 tests were had been conducted, of which only 11 were positive.",2020-06-19,"Król, Zbigniew; Szymański, Piotr; Bochnia, Adrian; Abramowicz, Emilia; Płachta, Agnieszka; Rzepliński, Radosław; Sługocki, Mikołaj; Nowak, Błażej; Zaczyński, Artur; Kozłowski, Krzysztof; Posobkiewicz, Marek; Wierzba, Waldemar",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.26444/aaem/123801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32588593/,220079523.0

METHODS: Eighty-three patients with LABC were scanned with 7 MHz ultrasound before starting NAC (week 0) and during treatment (week 4). Spectral parametric maps were generated corresponding to tumor volume. Twenty-four textural features (QUS-Tex1) were determined from parametric maps acquired using grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) for each patient, which were further processed to generate 64 texture derivatives (QUS-Tex1-Tex2), leading to a total of 95 features from each time point. Analysis was carried out on week 4 data and compared to baseline (week 0) data. ∆Week 4 data was obtained from the difference in QUS parameters, texture features (QUS-Tex1), and texture derivatives (QUS-Tex1-Tex2) of week 4 data and week 0 data. Patients were divided into two groups: recurrence and non-recurrence. Machine learning algorithms using k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and support vector machines (SVMs) were used to generate radiomic models. Internal validation was undertaken using leave-one patient out cross-validation method. RESULTS: With a median follow up of 69 months (range 7-118 months), 28 patients had disease recurrence. The k-NN classifier was the best performing algorithm at week 4 with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under curve (AUC) of 87%, 75%, 81%, and 0.83, respectively. The inclusion of texture derivatives (QUS-Tex1-Tex2) in week 4 QUS data analysis led to the improvement of the classifier performances. The AUC increased from 0.70 (0.59 to 0.79, 95% confidence interval) without texture derivatives to 0.83 (0.73 to 0.92) with texture derivatives. The most relevant features separating the two groups were higher-order texture derivatives obtained from scatterer diameter and acoustic concentration-related parametric images. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study highlighting the utility of QUS radiomics in the prediction of recurrence during the treatment of LABC.

Black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) have been revealed as a direct band gap semiconductor with ultrahigh conductivity, which have been explored in the present work as an additive component to a precursor solution of SnO2 nanoparticles that can effectively improve the performance of SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL)-based perovskite solar cells. Such a device can yield a high PCE of 21% with the SnO2/BPQDs mixed ETL, which is higher than those of perovskite solar cells based on SnO2 single layer (18.2%), BPQDs/SnO2 bilayer (19.5%), and SnO2/BPQDs bilayer (20.5%) samples. The mixed samples still possess good stability of more than 90% efficiency after 1000 h under AM 1.5G lamp irradiation and negligible hysteresis. It is found that the strong interaction of BPQDs with SnO2 can not only modify the defects inherent to the SnO2 layer but also inhibit the oxidation of BPQDs.

METHODS: Fifteen Tennessee APRNs who completed the National APRN Practice and Pandemic study also completed follow‐up interviews via a HIPAA‐compliant Zoom platform. Given the unprecedented circumstances associated with the COVID‐19 pandemic, we conducted a qualitative descriptive study seeking descriptions and unique perspectives of Tennessee APRNs. Consistent with qualitative study design, we conducted an atheoretical study that featured interviews, purposeful sampling with maximum variation sampling, and content analysis. RESULTS: The major themes were practice changes, impact of executive orders, and ongoing care barriers. The data revealed that patients, APRNs, and other health care providers were strained in new and profound ways during the pandemic. An underlying theme was Tennessee APRNs' frustration with continued regulatory and other practice barriers despite their state's health and health care disparities and under resourced health care system.

4cqdfkja,,ArXiv,On the time shift phenomena in epidemic models,,,,arxiv,"In the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) models, the peak of infected individuals coincides with the in ection point of removed individuals. Nevertheless, a survey based on the data of the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Istanbul, Turkey [19] displayed an unexpected time shift between the hospital referrals and fatalities. With the motivation of investigating the underlying reason, we use multistage SIR and SEIR models to provide an explanation for this time shift. Numerical solutions of these models present strong evidences that the delay is approximately half of the infection period of the epidemic disease. In addition, graphs of the classical SIR and the multistage SIR models; and the classical SEIR and the multistage SEIR models are compared for various epidemic parameters. Depending on the number of stages, it is observed that the delay varies for relatively small stage numbers whereas it does not change for large numbers in multistage systems. One important result that follows immediately from this observation is that this fixed delay for large numbers explains the time shift. Additionally, depending on the stage number and the duration of the epidemic disease, the distance between the points where each infectious stage reaches its maximum is found approximately both graphically and qualitatively for both systems. Variations of the time shift, the maximum point of the sum of all infectious stages, and the in ection point of the removed stage are observed subject to the stage number N and it is shown that these variations stay unchanged for greater values of N.",2019-09-25,"Dobie, Ayse Peker; Demirci, Ali; Bilge, Ayse Humeyra; Ahmetolan, Semra",,,,1909.11317,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11317v1.pdf,202750119.0

This pandemic has devastating effects on societies and economies around the world, and poor countries and continents are likely to face particularly serious and long-lasting damage, which could lead to large epidemic outbreaks because of the lack of financial and health resources. The increasing number of COVID-19 tests gives more information about the epidemic spread, and this can help contain the spread to avoid more infection. As COVID-19 keeps spreading, medical products, especially those needed to perform blood tests, will become scarce as a result of the high demand and insufficient supply and logistical means. However, technological tests based on deep learning techniques and medical images could be useful in fighting this pandemic. In this perspective, we propose a COVID-19 disease diagnosis (CDD) tool that implements a deep learning technique to provide automatic symptoms checking and COVID-19 detection. Our CDD scheme implements two main steps. First, the patient's symptoms are checked, and the infection probability is predicted. Then, based on the infection probability, the patient's lungs will be diagnosed by an automatic analysis of X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) images, and the presence of the infection will be accordingly confirmed or not.

Extensive contact tracing and testing in South Korea allows us to investigate the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 into diverse local communities. Objective. Understand the critical aspects of transmission dynamics in a different age, sex, and clusters with various activities. Methods. We conducted a retrospective observational study with 3,127 confirmed cases' contact tracing data from the Center for Disease and Prevention (CDC) of South Korea. We investigated network property concerning infected persons' demographics and different infection clusters. Findings. Overall, women had higher centrality scores than men after week four, when the confirmed cases rapidly increased. Older adults have higher centrality than young/middle-aged adults after week 9. In the infection clusters, young/middle-aged adults' infection clusters (such as religious gatherings and gym facilities) have higher average path lengths and diameter than older adults' nursing home infection clusters. Interpretation. Some women had higher reproduction numbers and bridged successive transmission than men when the confirmed cases rapidly increased.

The conformation of the spike protein can be either open or closed, yet it is unclear how the conformations affect the protein’s functions or what regulate the conformational changes. Using SARS-CoV-1 and bat RaTG13-CoV as comparisons, we identified two molecular switches that regulate the conformations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: (i) a furin motif loop turns SARS-CoV-2 spike from a closed conformation to a mixture of open and closed conformations, and (ii) a K417V mutation turns SARS-CoV-2 spike from mixed conformations to an open conformation. We showed that the open conformation favors viral potency by exposing the RBD for receptor binding and viral entry, whereas the closed conformation supports viral immune evasion by hiding the RBD from neutralizing antibodies. Hence SARS-CoV-2 spike has evolved to reach a balance between potency and immune evasiveness, which may contribute to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics between viral potency and invasiveness is likely to further evolve, providing insights into future evolution of SARS-CoV-2.",2021-10-01,"Wan, Yushun; Huang, Linfen; Zhang, Xiujuan; Shang, Jian; Perlman, Stanley; Du, Lanying; Li, Fang",Res Sq,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0fb9a7f0e4ab7b60438787378f4c1d4a48494536.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8491847.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611654/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-736159/v2,238409036.0

In this study we investigated whether NADPH exerted cardioprotection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. To induce myocardial I/R injury, rats were subjected to ligation of the left anterior descending branch of coronary artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. At the onset of reperfusion, NADPH (4, 8, 16 mg· kg(−1)· d(−1), iv) was administered to the rats. We found that NADPH concentrations in plasma and heart were significantly increased at 4 h after intravenous administration. Exogenous NADPH (8−16 mg/kg) significantly decreased myocardial infarct size and reduced serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and cardiac troponin I (cTn-I). Exogenous NADPH significantly decreased the apoptotic rate of cardiomyocytes, and reduced the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. In addition, exogenous NADPH reduced mitochondrial vacuolation and increased mitochondrial membrane protein COXIV and TOM20, decreased BNIP3L and increased Bcl-2 to protect mitochondrial function. We conducted in vitro experiments in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation/restoration (OGD/R). Pretreatment with NADPH (60, 500 nM) significantly rescued the cell viability and inhibited OGD/R-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with NADPH significantly increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and downregulated the phosphorylation of mTOR in OGD/R-treated NRCM. Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, abolished NADPH-induced AMPK phosphorylation and cardioprotection in OGD/R-treated NRCM. In conclusion, exogenous NADPH exerts cardioprotection against myocardial I/R injury through the activation of AMPK/mTOR pathway and inhibiting mitochondrial damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

This study aimed to highlight the encountered CT findings in 910 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Egypt including the mean severity score and also correlation between the initial CT finding and the short-term prognosis in 320 patients. RESULTS: All patients had confirmed COVID-19 infection. Non-contrast CT chest was performed for all cases; in addition, the correlation between each CT finding and disease severity or the short-term prognosis was reported. The mean age was higher for patients with unfavorable prognosis (P < 0.01). The patchy pattern was the most common, found in 532/910 patients (58.4%), the nodular pattern was the least common 123/910 (13.5%). The diffuse pattern was reported in 124 (13.6%). The ground glass density was the most common reported density in the study 512/910 (56.2%). The crazy pavement sign was reported more frequently in patients required hospitalization or ICU and was reported in 53 (56.9%) of patients required hospitalization and in 29 (40.2%) patients needed ICU, and it was reported in 11 (39.2%) deceased patients. Air bronchogram was reported more frequently in patients with poor prognosis than patients with good prognosis (16/100; 26% Vs 12/220; 5.4%). The mean CT severity score for patients with poor prognosis was 15.2. The mean CT severity score for patients with good prognosis 8.7., with statistically significant difference (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the important role of the initial CT findings in the prediction of clinical outcome and short-term prognosis. Some signs like subpleural lines, halo sign, reversed halo sign and nodular shape of the lesions predict mild disease and favorable prognosis. The crazy paving sign, dense vessel sign, consolidation, diffuse shape and high severity score predict more severe disease and probably warrant early hospitalization. The high severity score is most important in prediction of unfavorable prognosis.

Individual trials are tailoring successful approaches from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) to local cultures and environments. The network convened a forum for researchers to discuss statistical design and analysis issues they faced during the pandemic. We report on experiences of three trials that, at various stages of conduct, altered designs and analysis plans to navigate these issues. We provide recommendations for future trials to consider as they develop and launch behavioral intervention trials. RESULTS: The pandemic led researchers to change recruitment plans, interrupt timelines for assessments and intervention delivery, and move to remote intervention and assessment protocols. The necessity of these changes add emphasis to the importance, in study design and analysis, of intention to treat approaches, flexibility, within‐site stratification, interim power projections, and sensitivity analyses. DISCUSSION: Robust approaches to study design and analysis are critical to negotiate issues related to the intervention.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of referrals to and eligible donors from an eye bank between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, was performed, with the same time period in 2019 as a control. Referrals who were not procured because of Eye Bank Association of America COVID-19 guidelines and eye bank-specific restrictions were noted. The results of 1 month of routine postmortem testing performed by the eye bank were examined. Analysis of variance tests were performed to assess the change between donors from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in both the number of total referrals to the eye bank (P = 0.044) and donors eligible for surgical transplantation (P = 0.031). Eye Bank Association of America COVID-19 guidelines reduced the number of referrals over this period by 4% to 14%. Of the 266 surgically eligible donors who received postmortem COVID-19 testing in June by the eye bank, 13 resulted positive (4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a reduction in referrals and eligible corneal transplant donors at a single eye bank, there was a surplus of surgically suitable corneal tissue during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 3C-like protease (3CLpro), a highly conserved protease indispensable for replication of coronaviruses, is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. To advance the speed of drug discovery and development, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by natural products derived from Chinese traditional medicines. Baicalin and baicalein were identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography is distinctly different from those of known inhibitors. Baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a “shield” in front of the catalytic dyad to prevent the peptide substrate approaching the active site. The simple chemical structure, unique mode of action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.",2020-04-14,"Su, Haixia; Yao, Sheng; Zhao, Wenfeng; Li, Minjun; Liu, Jia; Shang, WeiJuan; Xie, Hang; Ke, Changqiang; Gao, Meina; Yu, Kunqian; Liu, Hong; Shen, Jingshan; Tang, Wei; Zhang, Leike; Zuo, Jianping; Jiang, Hualiang; Bai, Fang; Wu, Yan; Ye, Yang; Xu, Yechun",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/834c9f01bfe24ff36355dc80462859c4fb9780fc.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.038687,216071474.0

The objective of our study was to determine whether pregnant women with schizophrenia were at increased risk of pregnancy, delivery and neonatal complications compared with women without severe mental disorders. METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study of all singleton deliveries in France between Jan. 1, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2019. We divided this population into cases (i.e., women with schizophrenia) and controls (i.e., women without a diagnosis of severe mental disorder). Cases and controls were matched (1:4) inside the same hospital and the same year by age, social deprivation, parity, smoking, alcohol and substance addictions, malnutrition, obesity, and comorbidities. Univariate and multivariate models with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (ORs [95% CIs]) were used to estimate the association between schizophrenia and 24 pregnancy, delivery and neonatal outcomes. FINDINGS: Over 5 years, 3,667,461 singleton deliveries were identified, of which 3,108 occurred in women with schizophrenia. Compared to controls, women with schizophrenia were found to be older; have more frequent smoking, alcohol and substance addictions; suffer from obesity, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and often be hospitalized in tertiary maternity hospitals. Compared to matched controls, women with schizophrenia had more pregnancy complications (adjusted OR=1.41[95%CI 1.31-1.51]) (i.e., gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, genito-urinary infection, intrauterine growth retardation and threatened preterm labour). They had more delivery complications (aOR=1.18[95%CI 1.09 1.29]) with more still births/medical abortions (aOR=2.17[95%CI 1.62-2.90]) and caesarean sections (aOR=1.15[95%CI 1.05-1.25]). Newborns of women with schizophrenia had more neonatal complications (aOR=1.38[95%CI 1.27-1.50]) with more born preterm (aOR=1.64[95%CI1.42 -1.90]), small for gestational age (aOR=1.34[95%CI 1.19-1.50]) and low birth weight (aOR=1.75[95%CI 1.53-2.00]). INTERPRETATION: Our results highlight the importance of health disparities between pregnant women with and without schizophrenia, as well as in their newborns.

We measure life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and opioid-related deaths over five and ten years.Findings: Under the status quo, our model predicts that approximately 522,000 opioid-related deaths will occur from 2020 to 2024 (range 424,000 - 575,000), rising to 1,172,000 (range 956,000 - 1,308,000) by 2029. Expansion of naloxone availability had the largest effect: with 30% expansion, approximately 25% of opioid deaths would be averted. Pharmacotherapy, needle exchange, and psychosocial treatment are uniformly beneficial, reducing opioid-related deaths while leading to gains in life years and QALYs. Reduced prescribing for acute and transitioning pain (at the end of the first month of acute pain) would reduce lives lost over five and ten years. Reducing chronic pain prescribing, rescheduling drugs, and increasing excess opioid disposal programs would increase total deaths over five years as some opioid users escalate to heroin, but decrease deaths over ten years. Combined interventions would lead to greater increases in life years, QALYs, and deaths averted, although in many cases the results are subadditive.Interpretation: A combination of expanded health services for addicted individuals and reduced opioid prescribing would moderately lessen the severity of the opioid crisis over the next decade. Tragically, even with improved public policies, significant morbidity and mortality is inevitable.Funding: Grant R37-DA15612 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a grant from Stanford University School of Medicine to support the Stanford-Lancet Commission on the North American Opioid Crisis.Declaration of Interests: The authors have no conflict of interest to report.",2021,"Rao, Isabelle Humphreys Keith Brandeau Margaret",,,#ppcovidwho-319809,,,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3836493,236618571.0

A1pp inhibits adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation in the host and promotes viral infection and pathogenesis. We performed in silico screening of FDA approved drugs and nucleoside analogue library against the recently reported crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 A1pp domain. Docking scores and interaction profile analyses exhibited strong binding affinity of eleven FDA approved drugs and five nucleoside analogues NA1 (−13.84), nadide (−13.65), citicholine (−13.54), NA2 (−12.42), and NA3 (−12.27).

Twelve healthy young male participants underwent four 90-min trials comprising 70 min walking and 20 min resting periods. Cooling strategies adopted in this work were CON (control), PCM-control (PCMs were removed at the end of exercise), Fan-control (fans were switched OFF during the initial 20 min) and PCM&Fan-control (fans were turned ON after 20 min exercising and PCMs were removed after the 70-min exercise).

Key factors for efficient implementation include a patient-centered approach, engaging the major stakeholders, and incorporating telegenetics into existing health policies. Main barriers remain: limitations to billing and reimbursement, licensure, proper equipment and technical issues, engagement of referring providers and patients, coordination of services with local health providers, and lack of decision-making power. Further rigorous studies are needed to investigate the outcomes of telegenetics and to motivate health policies for change.

However, it remains unclear which individuals are most susceptible. Electrocortical markers of reward processing, such as the reward positivity (RewP), are implicated in depression risk and may provide insights into who is most vulnerable to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examined whether pre-pandemic neural correlates of reward reactivity (i.e., RewP) moderated the impact of social and financial stress on changes in youth and mother depression symptoms pre-to-post pandemic onset. Youth (n = 45) and mothers (n = 45) in the current sample were recruited prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as part of a larger study. RewP was assessed pre-pandemic, and depression symptoms were assessed pre- and post-pandemic onset for both youth and mothers. Additionally, social and financial chronic stress severity was assessed post-pandemic onset using a modified version of the UCLA Life Stress Interview. Financial stress was associated with prospective increases in depression for youth exhibiting blunted RewP at baseline. Similarly, family stress was associated with prospective increases in depression symptoms for mothers exhibiting blunted RewP at baseline.

Here, we present an integrated histopathological and virological analysis of CBs sampled at autopsy from four subjects (2 males and 2 females; age: >70 years old) who died of COVID-19. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular investigation techniques were employed to characterize Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) viral invasion and inflammatory reaction. SARS-CoV2 RNA was detected in the CBs of three cases through Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In these cases, positive immunostaining for Nucleocapsid and Spike protein were also demonstrated, mainly at the level of large roundish cells consistent with type I cells, confirming direct CB invasion. In these cases, T lymphocytes showed focal aggregations in the CBs, suggestive of local inflammatory reaction. Blood congestion and microthrombosis were also found in one of the positive cases. Intriguingly, microthrombosis, blood congestion and microhaemorrages were also bilaterally detected in the CBs of the negative case, supporting the possibility of COVID-19 effects on the CB even in the absence of its direct invasion. SARS-CoV-2 direct invasion of the CB is confirmed through both immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, with likely involvement of different cell types.

Amid the active usage of social networks and micro-blogs, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic, we may glean insights into any product or service through users' feedback and opinions. Thus, it is often difficult and time consuming to go through all the reviews and analyse them in order to recognize the notion of the overall goodness or badness of the reviews before making any decision. To overcome this challenge, sentiment analysis has been used as an effective rapid way to automatically gauge consumers' opinions. Large reviews will possibly encompass both positive and negative opinions on different features of a product/service in the same review. Therefore, this paper proposes an aspect-oriented sentiment classification using a combination of the prior knowledge topic model algorithm (SA-LDA), automatic labelling (SentiWordNet) and ensemble method (Stacking). The framework is evaluated using the dataset from different domains. The results have shown that the proposed SA-LDA outperformed the standard LDA. In addition, the suggested ensemble learning classifier has increased the accuracy of the classifier by more than ~3% when it is compared to baseline classification algorithms.

However, the impact of a pandemic outbreak on healthcare systems is yet to be clearly defined. Therefore, this work aims to describe and analyze specific areas of workload among different groups of healthcare workers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A sample of N = 8088 persons working in the German-speaking healthcare sector participated in the VOICE/egePan online survey, which addressed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. We used 15 self-constructed items, based on the work of Matsuishi et al. (2012), to identify potential COVID-19-specific topics. Results: N = 7542 records of healthcare workers were analyzed. Of these, 60.80% reported, retrospectively, an increase in stress since the outbreak of the pandemic. Problem areas tended to be indicated more frequently by the women surveyed than by the men. Nurses, paramedics and medical technicians reported the highest fear of infecting others while physicians reported the highest fear of physical or mental exhaustion. With respect to age, older respondents indicated less fear and felt more protected. Men and people living alone were more likely to use dysfunctional coping strategies. Migrants reported a higher fear of becoming infected or infecting others as well as they reported about increased levels of smoking. Discussion: Retrospectively, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in stress among healthcare workers.

The primary outcome was the ""reported CFR"" for patients with confirmed COVID-19 requiring IMV. ""Definitive hospital CFR"" for patients with outcomes at hospital discharge was also investigated. Finally, CFR was analyzed by patient age, geographic region, and study quality on the basis of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Measurements and Results: Sixty-nine studies were included, describing 57,420 adult patients with COVID-19 who received IMV. Overall reported CFR was estimated as 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39-52%). Fifty-four of 69 studies stated whether hospital outcomes were available but provided a definitive hospital outcome on only 13,120 (22.8%) of the total IMV patient population. Among studies in which age-stratified CFR was available, pooled CFR estimates ranged from 47.9% (95% CI, 46.4-49.4%) in younger patients (age &#8804;40 yr) to 84.4% (95% CI, 83.3-85.4%) in older patients (age >80 yr). CFR was also higher in early COVID-19 epicenters. Overall heterogeneity is high (I2 >90%), with nonsignificant Egger's regression test suggesting no publication bias.Conclusions: Almost half of patients with COVID-19 receiving IMV died based on the reported CFR, but variable CFR reporting methods resulted in a wide range of CFRs between studies.

People have little information about SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus). Internet has become a frequently used tool to obtain information in recent years, while YouTube is one of the popular sources of information with many videos on its platform. This study aims to identify the topics regarding Coronavirus that people learned about on YouTube. The videos about Coronavirus were also evaluated in terms of the reliability of their source of information. METHODS In total, 160 videos on Coronavirus that had 500,000 or more views were analysed. The latent Dirichlet allocation method was used in the process of identifying the topics that were then compared in terms of video parameters. The reliability of the source of information provided by videos was assessed with a modified DISCERN tool. RESULTS A proportion of 15.6 % of these videos had a scientific content, while 45 % of these videos were about the process entailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of video reliability, the difference between video types was found to be significant; videos with scientific content had more reliable sources of information (p<0.001).

Engineering cellular pathways related to cell death, metabolism and glycosylation in CHO cell is desired but challenging. Here we present a novel approach that exploits CRISPR-Cas13d for gene silencing and CHO cell engineering. CRISPR-Cas13d is a burgeoning system that exploits Cas13d nuclease and guide RNA (gRNA) for RNA cleavage and gene knockdown. We first showed that CRISPR-Cas13d effectively knocked down exogenous genes in CHO cell lines (K1, DG44 and DUXB11) commonly used for recombinant protein production. We next demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas13d robustly suppressed the expression of exogenous genes and various endogenous genes involved in gene amplification, apoptosis, metabolism and glycosylation (e.g. GS, BAK, BAX, PDK1 and FUT8) in CHO cells with efficiencies ranging from 60-80%, simply by transient transfection. By integrating the entire CRISPR-Cas13d system with the Sleeping Beauty system and optimal gRNA design, we further improved the knockdown efficiency and rapidly generated stable cells with ï»80-90% knockdown. With this approach, we knocked down FUT8 expression for >90% and significantly attenuated the IgG fucosylation.

Since COVID-19 disease was declared by the WHO there has been a redistribution of the healthcare system for these types of patients, especially in the front line, which is, in primary care, emergencies and in intensive care units (ICU). In primary care, the fundamental role is the diagnosis of the suspected patients, follow-up mainly by telemedicine (specially telephone calls) to detect warning signs in case of worsening and subsequent referral to the emergency department; as well as explaining home isolation measures. In the emergency department, it is included the management of suspicious cases and, if it any risk factor is found, complementary tests are carried out for precise diagnosis and admission assessment; In case of oxygen saturation <95% and poor general condition, valuation is requested for admission to the ICU.

Individuals with COPD typically experience a progressive, debilitating decline in lung function as well as systemic manifestations of the disease. Multimorbidity, is common in COPD patients and increases the risk of hospitalisation and mortality. Central to the genesis of multimorbidity in COPD patients is a self-perpetuating, abnormal immune and inflammatory response driven by factors including ageing, pollutant inhalation (including smoking) and infection. As many patients with COPD have multiple concurrent chronic conditions, which require an integrative management approach, there is a need to greater understand the shared disease mechanisms contributing to multimorbidity. The intercellular transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has recently been proposed as an important method of local and distal cell-to-cell communication mediating both homeostatic and pathological conditions. EVs have been identified in many biological fluids and provide a stable capsule for the transfer of cargo including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Of these cargo, microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short 17-24 nucleotide non-coding RNA molecules, have been amongst the most extensively studied. There is evidence to support that miRNA are selectively packaged into EVs and can regulate recipient cell gene expression including major pathways involved in inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis. Furthermore changes in EV cargo including miRNA have been reported in many chronic diseases and in response to risk factors including respiratory infections, noxious stimuli and ageing. In this review, we discuss the potential of EVs and EV-associated miRNA to modulate shared pathological processes in chronic diseases. Further delineating these may lead to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for patients with COPD and multimorbidities.",2021-12-02,"Reid, Laura V.; Spalluto, C.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The population of the present cross-sectional study was the parents of children studying in three randomly-selected schools in the western, eastern and central regions of Turkey. The study data were collected between May 15 and 31, 2020, using a descriptive questionnaire form and the Parenting Practices Scale applied to 1115 parents of children between 6 and 13 years of age. The data were analyzed using the SPSS 21.0 software package, and with descriptive, correlation and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: It was noted that 68% of the mothers did not work, and 40.2% of the fathers had shifted to a flexible work arrangement as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study revealed that 89.6% of the families had established ground rules related to screen time, and that the screen time of the children of 71.7% of the families had seen an increase, amounting to 6.42 ± 3.07 h/day.

p1mowozu,,WHO,Development of a simulation-based curriculum for paracentesis and thoracentesis,,,,unk,"RATIONALE: Despite the decline in the number and variety of procedures performed by general internal medicine (IM) physicians, procedural training remains an integral part of IM residency training. With previous success in improving the education and comfort of central venous catheter (CVC) placement among graduating 3rd year IM residents due to the development of a robust simulation-based curriculum for CVC placement, we desired to also develop a similar curriculum for paracentesis and thoracentesis. The aim of this project was to develop a simulation-based curriculum for paracentesis and thoracentesis to adequately train residents to safely and independently perform these common bedside procedures. METHODS: Using the CVC simulation-based curriculum as a framework, review of simulation literature and local facility protocols, a comprehensive checklist, pre-learning document and instructional video were developed for each procedure. Each checklist included details for procedural planning (supplies, informed consent, imaging review, time out), sterile preparation and procedure steps. The checklists were submitted to IM, Hepatology, and Pulmonary content experts for review. Residents were provided with the checklists, pre-learning documents and videos prior to a scheduled point-ofcare ultrasound (POCUS) workshop. Residents were also asked to complete pre-and post-workshop knowledge assessments. The workshop allowed for direct application of the checklists to safely complete each procedure in a simulation environment under the instruction of experienced physicians. RESULTS: Thirteen IM residents (9 PGY-1s, 3 PGY-2s, and 1 PGY-3) attended the POCUS workshop in March 2020. Prior to the workshop, residents self-reported, on average, 3.4 observed paracenteses with 1.6 performed and 2 observed thoracenteses with 0.33 performed. Ten residents completed a 12-question pre-workshop knowledge assessment with an average score of 50.8%. Twelve residents completed the same assessment after the workshop, and the average score improved to 68.2%. Resident perceived skill rating in using ultrasound and in performing bedside paracentesis and thoracentesis improved after the workshop (Table 1). Due to COVID-19, the workshop scheduled for May 2020 was cancelled and transitioned to a virtual platform which limited further data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Structured, simulation-based procedural education that teaches best practice and allows for deliberate practice and feedback has consistently been shown to improve the procedural skills of trainees. After completion of the paracentesis and thoracentesis workshop, residents demonstrated improvement in procedure knowledge, ultrasound use, and procedural skills, and we believe that our structured curriculum will provide residents with the necessary framework to perform these procedures safely at the bedside.",2021,"Jobe, A.

At present, the traditional methods for identifying genetically modified and non-transgenic soybeans are time-consuming, costly, and complicated to operate, which cannot meet the needs of practical applications. Therefore, it is necessary to discover a fast and accurate method for identifying transgenic soybeans. Terahertz (THz) time domain spectra were collected in sequence from 225 transgenic and non-transgenic soybean samples. Fourier transform was used to convert the terahertz time domain spectrum into a THz frequency domain spectrum with a frequency range of 0.1-2.5 THz. Firstly, the interval partial least squares (iPLS) method was used to remove interference spectral bands and select appropriate spectral intervals. Secondly, 168 samples were selected as the calibration set. Discriminant partial least squares (DPLS), Grid Search support vector machine (Grid Search-SVM) and principal component analysis back propagation neural network (PCA-BPNN) were used to establish a qualitative identification model. Afterwards, 57 test set samples were predicted. By comparing the experimental results, it was found that iPLS could effectively screen and remove the interference THz band, which was more helpful to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the identification model. After the iPLS and mean center pre-treatment technology, the Grid Search-SVM identification model had the best identification effect, with a total accuracy rate of 98.25% (transgenic identification rate was 96.15%, non-transgenic identification rate was 100%). This study shows that after selecting spectra from iPLS, THz spectroscopy combined with chemometrics can more accurately, quickly, and efficiently identify transgenic and non-transgenic soybeans.",2020-05-06,"Wei, Xiao; Zheng, Wanqin; Zhu, Shiping; Zhou, Shengling; Wu, Weiji; Xie, Zhiyong","Spectrochimica acta.

In the present study we sought to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on osteoblastic activity in the context of fracture healing. MicroRNA-4485 (miR-4485), which we found to be upregulated in COVID-19 patients, negatively regulates osteogenic differentiation. We demonstrate this effect both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we identified the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) as the potential target gene of miR-4485, and showed that reduction of TLR-4 induced by miR-4485 suppresses osteoblastic differentiation in vitro. Taken together, our findings highlight that up-regulation of miR-4485 is responsible for the suppression of osteogenic differentiation in COVID-19 patients, and TLR-4 is the potential target through which miR-4485 acts, providing a promising target for pro-fracture-healing and anti-osteoporosis therapy in COVID-19 patients.",2021,"Mi, Bobin; Xiong, Yuan; Zhang, Chenming; Zhou, Wu; Chen, Lang; Cao, Faqi; Chen, Fenghua; Geng, Zhi; Panayi, Adriana C; Sun, Yun; Wang, Lin; Liu, Guohui",Int J Biol Sci,,#covidwho-1191953,,,,,233241740.0

Since 2017, smoking illicit drugs has been the leading mode of drug administration causing overdose death. Yet, little is known about people who smoke opioids, and factors underlying choice of mode of administration. The study objectives are to identify the prevalence and correlates associated with smoking opioids. METHODS: The Harm Reduction Client Survey is a monitoring tool used by the BC Centre for Disease Control since 2012. This survey is disseminated to harm reduction sites across BC to understand drug use trends and drug-related harms. We examined data from the survey administered October–December 2019 and performed descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analyses to better understand factors associated with smoking opioids. RESULTS: A total of 369 people who used opioids in the past 3 days were included, of whom 251 (68.0%) reported smoking opioids. A total of 109 (29.5%) respondents experienced an overdose in the past 6 months; of these 79 (72.5%) smoked opioids. Factors significantly associated with smoking opioids were: living in a small community (AOR =2.41, CI =1.27–4.58), being a woman (AOR = 1.84, CI = 1.03–3.30), age under 30 (AOR = 5.41, CI = 2.19–13.40) or 30–39 (AOR = 2.77, CI = 1.33–5.78) compared to age ≥ 50, using drugs alone (AOR = 2.98, CI = 1.30–6.83), and owning a take-home naloxone kit (AOR = 2.01, CI = 1.08–3.72). Reported use of methamphetamines within the past 3 days was strongly associated with smoking opioids (AOR = 6.48, CI = 3.51–11.96). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight important correlates associated with smoking opioids, particularly the recent use of methamphetamines.

STAT3 is activated by secreted factors within the breast tumor, many of which are elevated and correlate to advanced disease and poor survival outcomes. This review examines how STAT3 signaling is activated in breast cancer by the proinflammatory, gp130 cytokines, interleukins 6 and 11. We evaluate how this signaling cascade functions in the various cells of the tumor microenvironment to drive disease progression and metastasis. We discuss how our understanding of these processes may lead to the development of novel therapeutics to tackle advanced disease. ABSTRACT: Interleukin (IL)-6 family cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-11, are defined by the shared use of the gp130 receptor for the downstream activation of STAT3 signaling and the activation of genes which contribute to the “hallmarks of cancer”, including proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis. Increased expression of these cytokines, or the ligand-specific receptors IL-6R and IL-11RA, in breast tumors positively correlate to disease progression and poorer patient outcome. In this review, we examine evidence from pre-clinical studies that correlate enhanced IL-6 and IL-11 mediated gp130/STAT3 signaling to the progression of breast cancer. Key processes by which the IL-6 family cytokines contribute to the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, immune evasion and metastatic potential, are discussed. We examine the latest research into the therapeutic targeting of IL-6 family cytokines that inhibit STAT3 transcriptional activity as a potential breast cancer treatment, including current clinical trials. The importance of the IL-6 family of cytokines in cellular processes that promote the development and progression of breast cancer warrants further understanding of the molecular basis for its actions to help guide the development of future therapeutic targets.",2022-01-15,"To, Sarah Q.; Dmello, Rhynelle S.; Richards, Anna K.; Ernst, Matthias; Chand, Ashwini L.",Cancers (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c61b0cefd13c142d41ced3597cce046cbbd75e18.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8773745.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35053592/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14020429,246028285.0

However, these public health measures have amplified frailty in our vulnerable older person population by increasing social disconnection, reducing exercise and access to early interventions. In response to this increasingly dependent older population we introduced a ‘frailty hub’ in our hospital.

METHODS: We performed a cross sectional review of our new hub which was introduced in our tertiary centre to priortise care of the older person.We analysed attendees from February to June 2021 (20 weeks of data). RESULTS: There were 121 new patient reviews and 127 follow up consultations.Commonly requested reason for referral was medical assessment (30%), cognitive assessments (30%) and falls(28%). Referral sources were analysed and included consultant referrals (11% n = 13), GP referrals (55% n = 67), multidisciplinary team referrals (6% n = 7) and emergency department referrals (26% n = 32).

First, the disciplinary interaction network is constructed through disciplinary co-occurrence to detect the characteristics of interaction structure among different disciplines. Then the node centrality index is employed to explore the influence of disciplines in the interactive network by using network centrality analysis. Moreover, the dynamic of discipline interaction evolution is studied using blockmodeling analysis. In the field of PHE, the number of disciplines and the intensity of interaction among different subjects gradually increased in the past 20 years. Chemistry and Material Sciences are the core discipline, and they play an important role in the network. The whole network is divided into different discipline groups.

Laryngeal ultrasound (LUS) may be an alternative, less invasive means of evaluating VFMI that also decreases aerosolization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective was to examine LUS interpretation proficiency for VFMI via an educational module. A secondary outcome was to determine whether quantitative measurements increase interpretation accuracy. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort trial. METHODS Medical students, residents, fellows, faculty, and staff were recruited to complete the module, composed of a 13-minute teaching video followed by 20 cases. Participants determined both qualitatively (subjective assessment) and then quantitatively (through protractor measurements of the vocal fold to arytenoid angle) whether there was normal versus impaired vocal fold mobility. RESULTS Thirty participants completed the LUS training module, and about one-third were otolaryngology residents. On average, each participant correctly identified 18 cases. The mean rank percent correct for quantitative measurements was significantly higher than that of qualitative interpretations (P < .0001). Measurements significantly caused participants to change their answer correctly compared to incorrectly (P < .0001). As the module progressed, there was no significant trend of more correct interpretations (P = .30). The sensitivity was higher for quantitative interpretations (89.0% vs. 87.3%) but specificity remained unchanged (92.6%). CONCLUSION Quantitative measurements may increase LUS interpretation accuracy. There was not a specific number of cases interpreted to achieve learning proficiency. LUS is an easily learned method to evaluate for VFMI across all training levels.

The Act included a new focus on cancer control, including the requirement that the NCI award research grants and contracts, in collaboration with other public agencies and private industry, to conduct cancer control activities related to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cancer. The requirement placed the NCI at the nexus of a rapidly changing science and a complex and dynamic healthcare delivery system and involved an evolutionary transformation to advance cancer control and cancer care delivery research along the cancer care continuum. Analysis is based on a qualitative ethnographic approach using historical records, oral histories, and targeted interviews. The multimethod approach provided the opportunity to describe to the vision, leadership, and struggle to build an infrastructure, expand expertise, and forge collaboration with the NCI and a complex and changing healthcare system.

Clinical symptoms range from barely noticeable to very severe. It is crucial to recognize imaging patterns of COVID-19, allowing for better diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostic imaging is also essential in monitoring patients in the course of the disease. Objective: In our pictorial review we describe the most common pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, and show the typical and non-typical features of COVID-19 encountered in our hospital in Lublin, Poland. Imaging the disease progression is also visualized to help realize how pulmonary changes occur over the time. State of knowledge and Conclusions: COVID-19 involves both lung parenchyma and interstitium and has multiple imaging features, varying form ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidations, reticular interstitial pattern, honeycombing or crazy-paving. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement or pleural effusion may appear, but are rare and atypical. GGO are located peripherally, bilaterally and predominantly in the lower lobes, and in the early stage are better seen on CT imaging. Progression of imaging findings take different times, with the peak of of imaging features appearing around 10–14 days after initial symptoms. While it is harder to discern subtle changes on CXR, progression can be very well monitored by his method.

Despite widespread recent adoption of these laws, use of ERPOs has been limited. Barriers to ERPO uptake remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess public awareness and perceived appropriateness of and willingness to use ERPOs in various risk scenarios, and to identify reasons for being unwilling, overall and by firearm ownership status, to inform efforts to improve ERPO implementation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a cross-sectional study using data from the 2020 California Safety and Wellbeing Survey, a statewide internet survey on firearm ownership and exposure to violence and its consequences, conducted from July 14 to July 27, 2020. Adult respondents were recruited from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel using probability-based sampling methods. Responses were weighted to be representative of the adult population of California. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Awareness and perceived appropriateness of gun violence restraining orders (GVROs; California’s official term for ERPOs), willingness to use a GVRO for a family member at risk of harm, and reasons for being not at all willing to use a GVRO in 1 or more risk scenarios, overall and by firearm ownership status. RESULTS: Of the 5018 panel members invited, 2870 (57%) completed the survey. Of these respondents (mean [SD] age: 47.9 [16.9] years; 52.3% women; 41.9% White, 34.7% Latinx, 14.4% Asian, and 5.8% Black individuals), 65.6% (95% CI, 63.0%-68.1) had never heard of a GVRO or a red flag law. Firearm owners were significantly more likely (20.5%; 95% CI, 15.9%-26.0%) than nonowners who live with owners (6.1%; 95% CI, 3.7%-10.0%; P < .001) and nonowners (9.6%; 95% CI, 7.8%-11.6%; P < .001) to have heard of both a GVRO and a red flag law. After reading a brief description of California’s GVRO law, 72.9% (95% CI, 70.2%-75.4%) to 78.4% (95% CI, 75.9%-80.8%) of respondents, depending on the risk scenario, indicated that GVROs were in general at least sometimes appropriate, while 73.2% (95% CI, 70.5%-75.6%) to 83.6% (95% CI, 81.2%-85.8%) said they would be somewhat or very willing to use a GVRO for a family member at risk of harm. Firearm owners reported the highest levels of GVRO appropriateness in 4 of 5 risk scenarios (depending on the scenario, 80.0% [95% CI, 73.6%-85.1%] to 85.6% [95% CI, 79.9%-89.8%]). Nonowners who live with owners reported the highest levels of personal willingness to use a GVRO (depending on the scenario, 83.7% [95% CI, 74.7%-90.0%] to 94.7% [95% CI, 86.2%-98.1%]). The most frequently cited reasons for being unwilling to use a GVRO were not knowing enough about GVROs (44.9%; 95% CI, 39.7%-50.3%), believing the risk scenarios are personal or family matters (26.6%; 95% CI, 22.2%-31.6%), and distrust that the system will be fair (23.1%; 95% CI, 19.1%-27.6%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional survey study, public awareness of GVROs was low, but perceived appropriateness of and willingness to use these tools at least some of the time was high. Foci for efforts to address barriers to GVRO use in California were identified; similar challenges likely exist in other jurisdictions.",2021-06-04,"Kravitz-Wirtz, Nicole; Aubel, Amanda J.; Pallin, Rocco; Wintemute, Garen J.",JAMA Health Forum,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8796972.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8796972/,

Nevertheless, more complex surgical procedures have brought a higher complexity and longer duration for general anesthesia, which has led to a series of adverse events such as hemodynamic instability, under- or overdosage of anesthetic drugs, and an increased number of post-anesthetic events. In order to adapt the anesthesia according to the particularities of each patient, the multimodal monitoring of these patients is highly recommended. Classically, general anesthesia monitoring consists of the analysis of vital functions and gas exchange. Multimodal monitoring refers to the concomitant monitoring of the degree of hypnosis and the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance. By titrating anesthetic drugs according to these parameters, clinical benefits can be obtained, such as hemodynamic stabilization, the reduction of awakening times, and the reduction of postoperative complications. Another important aspect is the impact on the status of inflammation and the redox balance. By minimizing inflammatory and oxidative impact, a faster recovery can be achieved that increases patient safety.

It is not only regarded as a rehabilitative treatment but also a pretreatment method for stroke. However, its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, rats were treated with electroacupuncture (EA) at Baihui (GV20) for 30 min/day for 6 days, ahead of conducting cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Infarction volume, Evans blue leakage, and neurological deficits were evaluated at 24 h after I/R injury. Then, the ipsilateral ischemic brain was isolated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify molecular consequences. The results showed that EA pretreatment decreased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, reduced brain infarction volume, and improved neurological outcomes. EA pretreatment could upregulate expression of antivirus and immunity activity-associated genes (such as Ifit1, Ifit3, Irf7, and Oasla) and downregulate expression of matrix disruption-associated genes (Col24a1, Col11a1, Col27a1, etc.) in healthy rats. In addition, it could partially reverse or ameliorate genome-wide transcription changes of the ipsilateral ischemic brain.

Selective genetic deletion in macrophages results in a remarkable gain in protection from infection with the prevalent lung pathogen, pneumococcus. In contrast, neutrophils lacking EZH2 showed impaired mobility in response to chemotactic signals, and resulted in increased susceptibility to pneumococcus. In summary, EZH2 shows complex, and divergent roles in different myeloid lineages, likely contributing to the earlier conflicting reports.

Previous research has shown that patients usually have positive experiences of online therapy, however, with large individual differences. The aim of this study was to explore patients’ experiences of transition from in-person psychotherapy sessions to telepsychotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as variation in the experiences with regard to the patients’ personality orientation. Seven psychotherapy patients in Sweden were interviewed and the transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Additionally, the participants were asked to rate their dissatisfaction/satisfaction with the transition, how hindering/helpful the transition was, and how unsafe/safe they felt after the transition in comparison to before. Personality orientation on relatedness or self-definition was assessed applying a self-assessment instrument (Prototype Matching of Anaclitic-Introjective Personality Configuration; PMAI). The participants experienced telepsychotherapy as qualitatively different from in-person psychotherapy. They reported several essential losses: the rituals surrounding therapy sessions were lost, including the transitional time and space between their every-day life and the therapy sessions, less therapeutic work was done, the therapists could lose their therapeutic stance, the sense of rapport was impaired, and the patients felt less open and emotionally available. On the other hand, some patients could feel freer online. As six of the participants had an anaclitic personality orientation, the present study could especially contribute to the understanding of how patients with strong affiliative needs and fear of abandonment experience the transition to meeting their therapists via communication technology. The participants’ self-ratings showed that they were only marginally dissatisfied with the transition and experienced the transition as slightly hindering, whereas they felt rather safe after the transition, indicating low concordance between qualitative and quantitative evaluations. New studies are needed to explore the introjective patients’ experiences of the transition. An essential topic is also to collect evidence and to test how the impaired sense of rapport when using communication technology can be remedied by adequate, patient-tailored interventions, a topic that has to be included in psychotherapy education and training.",2022-03-24,"Werbart, Andrzej; Byléhn, Linda; Jansson, Tuva Maja; Philips, Björn",Front Psychol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2d137a83a930a7dae38437225557f271688c9bd8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8988038.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.835214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35401368/,247769205.0

Although not much was known about the new virus, the first outbreaks in China and Italy showed that potentially a large number of people worldwide could fall critically ill in a short period of time. A shortage of ventilators and intensive care resources was expected in many countries, leading to concerns about restrictions of medical care and preventable deaths. In order to be prepared for this challenging situation, national triage guidance has been developed or adapted from former influenza pandemic guidelines in an increasing number of countries over the past few months. In this article, we provide a comparative analysis of triage recommendations from selected national and international professional societies, including Australia/New Zealand, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Pakistan, South Africa, Switzerland, the United States, and the International Society of Critical Care Medicine. We describe areas of consensus, including the importance of prognosis, patient will, transparency of the decision‐making process, and psychosocial support for staff, as well as the role of justice and benefit maximization as core principles. We then probe areas of disagreement, such as the role of survival versus outcome, long‐term versus short‐term prognosis, the use of age and comorbidities as triage criteria, priority groups and potential tiebreakers such as ‘lottery’ or ‘first come, first served’. Having explored a number of tensions in current guidance, we conclude with a suggestion for framework conditions that are clear, consistent and implementable.

In multinomial logistic regression models participants with higher pre-pandemic personal mastery, a construct related to self-efficacy, were more likely to report “both positive and negative” impact of the pandemic than a solely “negative” impact (OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.29–3.65). Higher perceived stress and frequent contact with family prior to the pandemic were also associated with pandemic impact. These observations highlight the relevance of psychosocial factors in the COVID-19 pandemic experience and identify characteristics that may inform interventions in future public health crises.

A standardized, validated method of assessing acute postoperative pain would improve the quality of clinical studies, and facilitate systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A step on the way towards this standard is to investigate the methods most commonly used in recent literature. METHODS PubMed and CINAHL databases were searched, including studies of arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery with a primary pain-related outcome during the first postoperative week, published in English from 2012 to 2017. RESULTS A total of 47 studies were included, all measuring pain intensity using a pain rating scale. Most frequently used was the visual analogue scale using the anchors ""no pain"" and ""worst pain imaginable"", with recordings at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. A total of 34 studies recorded analgesic consumption, usually as average cumulated consumption in mg. Time to first analgesic request or first pain were recorded in 11 studies, and 4 different starting points were used. DISCUSSION This review describes the currently most common methods of assessing acute postoperative pain in clinical trials of arthroscopic shoulder surgery involving rotator cuff repair, and the large variety of methods applied. Based on this study and international guidelines, several recommendations on how to measure and report postoperative pain outcomes in future trials are proposed.",2018,"Rasmussen, Jacob Korsbæk; Nikolajsen, Lone; Bjørnholdt, Karen Toftdahl",SICOT-J,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1051/sicotj/2018042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30465647/,53719351.0

It also allows access to inaccessible and underdeveloped locations. Better treatment outcomes were documented in patients treated by an orthodontist supervised by teledentistry than by a general dentist with minimal orthodontic experience alone. It may also help to focus referrals to specialists and weed out those who do not need them. But, on a critical note, a doctor-patient relationship is much more than a business transaction. A face-to-face initial consultation instills trust that a remote session cannot. Teledentistry includes professional networking of doctors. This contact includes digital information exchange, CPD programs, case discussions, and analysis that bring dentists from all around the world together to improve patient care. Teledentistry has not only spanned the distance between dentists worldwide, but has also served as a conduit between customer (patient) and manufacturer. This spawned Direct to Consumer (DTC) dentistry, sparking substantial debate among dentists worldwide. In DTC dentistry, inadequately trained customers conduct complex procedures on themselves with minimal guidance of a dentist. One of the major issues today is the general availability of clear aligners to patients without the requirement for an intermediary skilled orthodontist. The American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) has publicly questioned the validity of Smile Direct Club, a private firm that dominates the DTC industry. European Federation of Orthodontic Specialists Association, on the other hand, has sponsored a joint declaration with the representative orthodontic associations in Europe to highlight and alert patients about the potential risks of DTC products. Unfortunately, public shaming hasn't slowed commercialization of DTC firms. Teledentistry has been a boon for healthcare, but a nightmare for our profession, raising fundamental questions like what is the difference between a customer and a patient? Is dentistry a just another discipline of cosmetics? Is teledentistry making us less connected with our patients?",2022-01-28,"Venugopal, Adith; Bowman, S.

The current study examined changing media use patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effect of these patterns on feelings of concern regarding one's future and society, and the moderating roles of anxiety and depression in relations. Seventy-four college students (70% female;55% White, 24% Pell-grant eligible) completed an online survey assessing time spent on TV, social media, and video game use in spring of 2019 (T1) and spring of 2020 (T2). Results revealed TV and video game, but not social media, use increased from T1 to T2, and change in TV use positively predicted an increased concern about society. Further, moderation analyses showed increased social media use raised concern for one's future at lower levels of anxiety. Change in social media use raised concern for society at higher levels of depression. This study advances our understanding of college students' interactions with media during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting some types of media may have been used as coping mechanisms with various effects on concern for self and others.

More TV viewing predicted increased concern for society, perhaps due to constant reporting on deaths, hospital crowding, and virus spread on TV news. Increasing social media use also was related to increased concern for one's future for students low in anxiety and concern for society for students high in depression, potentially due to worrisome posts and dire news stories being posted at high rates.

For countries that have implemented restrictions on its population in a step-wise manner, monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence is of importance to guide decision on when to impose new, or when to abolish old, restrictions. We are here determining whether measures of odor intensity in a large sample can serve as one such measure. Online measures of how intense common household odors are perceived and symptoms of COVID-19 were collected from 2440 Swedes. Average odor intensity ratings were then compared to predicted COVID-19 population prevalence over time in the Swedish population and were found to closely track each other (r=-0.83). Moreover, we found that there was a large difference in rated intensity between individuals with and without COVID-19 symptoms and number of symptoms was related to odor intensity ratings. Finally, we found that individuals progressing from reporting no symptoms to subsequently reporting COVID-19 symptoms demonstrated a large drop in olfactory performance. These data suggest that measures of odor intensity, if obtained in a large and representative sample, can be used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease in the general population.

However, the GDPs and annual economic growth rates show a depreciation. This is because the states dependent on oil export, tourism, commercial services, industry, and wholesale and retail trade are severely affected.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has compounded the opioid crisis and worsened outcomes by introducing new barriers to MOUD access. Many strategies to ensure continued access to MOUD have been described, but the role of leveraging pharmacists during the opioid/COVID-19 syndemic to improve medication access and outcomes remains underappreciated. Pharmacists, while both qualified and capable of liberalizing access to all forms of MOUD, may have the strongest impact by increasing access to buprenorphine. Herein we present progressive strategies to maintain and extend buprenorphine access for patients with OUD through deployment of clinical pharmacists, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which access may be further restricted. CONCLUSION: Leveraging pharmacists to extend access to MOUD, particularly buprenorphine, remains an underutilized strategy that should be implemented, particularly during the concurrent COVID-19 global pandemic.",2021,"Peckham, Alyssa M; Ball, Jennifer; Colvard, Michelle D; Dadiomov, David; Hill, Lucas G; Nichols, Stephanie D; Tallian, Kimberly; Ventricelli, Daniel J; Tran, Tran H",,,#1012819,,,,,231195467.0

To date, no specific treatment or effective vaccine is available. Antibodies produced by plasma cells (PCs) might be involved concomitantly in protection and severe dengue immunopathology. Although a massive appearance of PCs has been reported during acute DENV infection in humans, this response has been poorly characterized. Here, we show the dynamic of PC generation in immune-competent mice cutaneously inoculated with DENV compared with two control experimental groups: mice inoculated with inactivated DENV or with PBS. We found that PC numbers increased significantly in the skin-draining lymph node (DLN), peaking at day 10 and abruptly decreasing by day 14 after DENV inoculation. Class-switched IgG(+) PCs appeared from day 7 and dominated the response, while in contrast, the frequency of IgM(+) PCs decreased from day 7 onwards. Even though the kinetic of the response was similar between DENV- and iDENV-inoculated mice, the intensity of the response was significantly different. Interestingly, we demonstrated a similar PC response to virus antigens (E and prM) by ELISPOT. In situ characterization showed that PCs were distributed in the medullary cords and in close proximity to germinal centers (GCs), suggesting both an extrafollicular and a GC origin. Proliferating PCs (Ki-67(+)) were found as early as 3-day postinoculation, and in-depth analysis showed that these PCs were in active phases of cell cycle during the kinetic. Finally, we found a progressive appearance of high-affinity neutralizing DENV-specific IgG further supporting GC involvement. Of note, these antibodies seem to be highly cross-reactive, as a large proportion recognizes Zika virus (ZIKV). The strong PC response to skin-inoculated DENV in this work resembles the findings already described in humans. We consider that this study contributes to the understanding of the in vivo biology of the humoral immune response to DENV in an immunocompetent murine model.",2021-04-26,"Maqueda-Alfaro, Raúl A.; Marcial-Juárez, Edith; Calderón-Amador, Juana; García-Cordero, Julio; Orozco-Uribe, Mariana; Hernández-Cázares, Felipe; Medina-Pérez, Uziel; Sánchez-Torres, Luvia E.; Flores-Langarica, Adriana; Cedillo-Barrón, Leticia; Yam-Puc, Juan C.; Flores-Romo, Leopoldo",J Immunol Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bfca32ecb0884a89e221b55af7693b7e11fa05a9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8096554.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5511841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33997054/,234494372.0

As, the roads are not crowded, and the malls, transport, institutes, and industries are closed, there is significant improvement in the climate. The present study intends to review these positive changes in climate, and the lessons human should learn from the pandemic, COVID-19. The data related to the effect of human interactions on nature, and the results of lock-down was collected from international newspapers, scholarly articles from peer reviewed journals, and WHO database. The data showed that, after lock-down, there is improvement in the quality of air, the green house gas emission has significantly reduced, and amount of industrial wastes poured in rivers has dropped down, making the water clearer.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was initiated to clarify the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic context. Methods We performed an electronic search through Pubmed and Global Index Medicus databases. We included observational studies reporting the detection rate of common respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis using molecular assays. Data was extracted and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroups, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effect model. Results The final meta-analysis included 51 studies. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) was largely the most commonly detected virus 59.2%; 95% CI [54.7; 63.6]). The second predominant virus was Rhinovirus (RV) 19.3%; 95% CI [16.7; 22.0]) followed by Human bocavirus (HBoV) 8.2%; 95% CI [5.7; 11.2]). Other reported viruses included Human Adenovirus (HAdV) 6.1%; 95% CI [4.4; 8.0]), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) 5.4%; 95% CI [4.4; 6.4]), Human Parainfluenzavirus (HPIV) 5.4%; 95% CI [3.8; 7.3]), Influenza 3.2%; 95% CI [2.2; 4.3], mild Human Coronavirus (HCoV) 2.9%; 95% CI [2.0; 4.0]), and Enterovirus (EV) 2.9%; 95% CI [1.6; 4.5]).

However, comparative studies of the most widely used Solitaire and Trevo stents have been rarely published.The authors retrospectively reviewed a total of 200 patients who performed mechanical thrombectomy at our center during 4 years and divided patients into 2 groups: mechanical thrombectomy with Solitaire stent (Group 1: Solitaire) and mechanical thrombectomy with Trevo stent (Group 2: Trevo). All patients underwent a clinical assessment with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and underwent modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Radiologic results were evaluated using thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score and number of stent passes. In addition, multiple time intervals were analyzed.There was no statistically significant difference in clinical outcome between the 2 groups. Trevo group revealed the shorter procedure time, less number of stent passage, and more one pass cases than Solitaire group with statistically significance (P = .009, P = .014, P = .030). In addition, Trevo group achieved higher successful recanalization (TICI 2b or 3) rate (89.7%) with statically significant than group1 (82.3%) (P = .018). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of Trevo stent was a predictive for successful recanalization. (odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.250-1.550, P = .028).Our study suggests that the Trevo stent allows higher recanalization rate through the less number of stent passages and shorter procedure time than the Solitaire stent.

AIM: We investigated the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on hospitalizations for ACS and related invasive procedures in a country with low COVID 19 incidence. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, observational retrospective study including all consecutive patients admitted for ACS in the Cardiology Department of University Hospital Center Mother Theresa from March 9, 2020 (1st day of application of social distance measures) to April 30th (period of total lockdown). Patients admitted in the same time period in 2019 served as controls. All data were collected from the medical files. Admissions were classified as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTEACS). Total and weekly admissions and invasive procedures were assessed. Mean incidence difference (MID) in weekly ACS admissions and procedures was also calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 781 patients were included in this analysis: 321 patients (37%) were admitted during study period and 550 patients (63%) were admitted during the control period (overall reduction of 41.6%;weekly MID of 28.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.3 to 44.0;p = 0.001). The occurrence of all ACS types was reduced: STEMI, by 28.1%;weekly MID 7.3 [0.6-15.2];p = 0.048];NSTEACS by 50.5%, weekly MID 19.1 [13.9-24.4];p <0.001]. Invasive procedures were also reduced: coronary angiography by 42.5%, weekly MID 26.6 [13.4-39.2];p = 0.001];percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by 42.3%, weekly MID 16.1 [5.9-26.3], p = 0.004].

Here, by combining observational data and simulations, this work aims to understand the diverse air quality response in two city clusters, Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) and Pearl River Delta region (PRD), China. Though there was a noticeable drop in primary pollutants in both the regions, differently, the maximum daily 8 h average ozone (O(3)) soared by 20.6–76.8% in YRD but decreased by 15.5–28.1% in PRD. In YRD, nitrogen oxide (NOx) reductions enhanced O(3) accumulation and hence increased secondary aerosol formation. Such an increment in secondary organic and inorganic aerosols under stationary weather reached up to 36.4 and 10.2%, respectively, which was further intensified by regional transport. PRD was quite the opposite. The emission reductions benefited PRD air quality, while regional transport corresponded to an increase of 17.3 and 9.3% in secondary organic and inorganic aerosols, respectively. Apart from meteorology, the discrepancy in O(3)–VOCs–NOx relationships determined the different O(3) responses, indicating that future emission control shall be regionally specific, instead of one-size-fits-all cut.

However, the longitudinal association of biomarkers reflecting CNS impact and neurological symptoms is not known. We wished to determine whether plasma biomarkers of CNS injury were associated with neurologic sequelae after COVID‐19. METHOD: Patients with confirmed acute COVID‐19 were studied prospectively. Neurological symptoms were recorded during the acute phase of the disease and at six months follow‐up, and blood samples were collected longitudinally. Healthy age‐matched individuals were included as controls. We analyzed plasma concentrations of neurofilament light‐chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp), and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF‐15). RESULT: We recruited 100 patients with mild (n = 24), moderate (n = 28), and severe (n = 48) COVID‐19 who were followed for a median of (IQR) 225 (187–262) days. In the acute phase, patients with severe COVID‐19 had higher concentrations of NfL than all other groups (all p < 0.001) and higher GFAp than controls (p < 0.001). GFAp was also significantly increased in moderate disease (p < 0.05) compared with controls. NfL (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) and GFAp (r = 0.39, p < 0.001) correlated with GDF‐15 during the acute phase. After six months, NfL and GFAp concentrations had normalized, with no persisting group differences. Despite this, 50 patients reported persistent neurological symptoms, most commonly included fatigue (n = 40), “brain‐fog” (n = 29), and changes in cognition (n = 25). We found no relation between persistent neurological symptoms and CNS injury biomarkers in the acute phase. CONCLUSION: The normalization of CNS injury biomarkers in all individuals, regardless of previous disease severity or persisting neurological symptoms, indicate that post‐acute COVID‐19 neurological sequelae are not accompanied by ongoing CNS injury.

Thus, measuring contact mixing patterns, often in the form of a contacts matrix, has been a key component of heterogeneous disease transmission modeling research. Several data collection techniques estimate or calculate a contacts matrix at different geographical scales and population mixes based on surveys and sensors. This paper presents a methodology for generating a contacts matrix by using high fidelity simulations which mimic actual workflow and movements of individuals in time and space. Results of this study show that such simulations can be a feasible, flexible, and reasonable alternative method for estimating social contacts and generating contacts mixing matrices for various settings under different conditions.",2021-01-25,"Najafabadi, Mahdi M.; Asgary, Ali; Tofighi, Mohammadali; Tofighi, Ghassem",,,,2101.10224,document_parses/pdf_json/bc0e8a4e0685466421edf2c607fcd13345a950ef.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10224v5.pdf,231699069.0

In detail, this study used structural equation modeling to explore the relationships among specific predictors (self-regulation, teaching presence, and social presence), learning engagement, and learning persistence in BSL. We recruited 319 students who were enrolled in BSL at a Chinese university. The online survey was administered to gather data on the variables of this study. The results demonstrated that self-regulation, teaching presence, and social presence were positively associated with learning engagement. Self-regulation and learning engagement were positively associated with learning persistence. Moreover, learning engagement mediated the relationships between self-regulation, teaching presence, social presence, and learning persistence.

The consequence is poor health outcomes and premature death. Ample previous literature documents health inequities in the morbidity and mortality statistics for Black and Brown people in the United States. Their excess deaths are due to disproportionately high rates of serious health conditions (diabetes; hypertension; asthma; and lung, kidney, and heart disease), as well as structural factors having to do with income, employment, and the built environment in which they live. The health conditions are exacerbated with ongoing societal problems and stress emerging from the country's history of dehumanizing racial inequities. Current discrimination comes most virulently in the form of systematic and institutionalized racist policies that keep racial and ethnic minorities marginalized and disempowered. Furthermore, people of color encounter the immediate external pressures of working away from home and using public transportation during the country's extraordinary ongoing lockdown, heightening the risk of exposure to the virus. Moreover, the same population is overrepresented in jails and prisons where social distancing is impossible. Any virulent virus without a vaccine is bound to become a human petri dish in which people of color in the U.S. today are caught. The war against the coronavirus for people of color is part and parcel of the war to eliminate historic inequities and to level the socioeconomic playing field. This article covers the racial/ethnic inequities in morbidity and mortality from COVID19 and the slow and untimely response by the federal government to address mediation of the spread of the virus.

odtx3axs,,WHO,Assessing the hospital surge capacity of the Kenyan health system in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic,,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic will test the capacity of health systems worldwide and especially so in low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this study was to assess the surge capacity of the Kenyan of the Kenyan health system in terms of general hospital and ICU beds in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months. We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point. We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments. RESULTS: The capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply. There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties. For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county. Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity. Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit. Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Significant gaps exist in Kenya's capacity for hospitals to accommodate a potential surge in caseload due to COVID-19. Alongside efforts to slow and supress the transmission of the infection, the Kenyan government will need to implement adaptive measures and additional investments to expand the hospital surge capacity for COVID-19. Additional investments will however need to be strategically prioritized to focus on strengthening essential services first, such as oxygen availability before higher cost investments such as ICU beds and ventilators.",2020,"Barasa, Edwine W; Ouma, Paul O; Okiro, Emelda A",PLoS One,,#650507,,,,,215782400.0

Faculty members have since adopted a series of contingent measures to enhance teaching and learning experience during the pandemic, which includes facilitating active learning, exploring new teaching content related to public health, expanding e-learning resources, implementing more engaged and student-centred assessment and delivering high-impact integrated education and research. The key challenges that faculty members are facing appear to be how to maximise the flexibility of learning and meet physical distancing requirements without compromising learning outcomes, education equity and interpersonal interactions in the traditional face-to-face teaching. Despite the challenges imposed by the pandemic, this could also be a good opportunity for faculty members obliged to lecture, to rethink and revise the existing contents and approaches of professing GGE education. Three future opportunities namely, smart learning, flipped learning and interdisciplinary education, are identified.

The increased risk to the health of diabetic patients, with comorbidities in harsh situations like COVID-19 pandemics, necessitates real-time monitoring of blood glucose. Monitoring of blood glucose is invasive, hence, sweat glucose monitoring can be an alternative approach to address the invasive issue in blood glucose monitoring. This work reports a facile, low-cost, high-performance nonenzymatic copper (Cu) native oxide (CuNOx)-based electrochemical sensor for sweat glucose sensing. We utilized a very thin Cu native oxide of ~10 nm on Cu thin film for the sensing because of the excellent catalytic oxidation behavior of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) to glucose. The anodic sweep of cyclic voltammetry of glucose showed that the hydroxyl ions from sodium hydroxide convert the electrode surface into different oxides [Cu(I), Cu(II) Cu(III)], which electro-oxidize glucose to gluconolactone, then eventually to gluconic acid resulting in oxidation current. The CuNOx sensors exhibited a sensitivity of 603.42 μA mM−1 cm−2, a linear range beyond the desired limit of 7.00 mM with excellent linearity, and a low limit of detection of 94.21 μM. Excellent repeatability and stability (stable >1 year) with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 2.67%, and 2.70%, respectively were achieved for 1 mM glucose. The selectivity with common interferants of glucose in human sweat and blood showed an RSD of 3.56%.

As older adults are at increased risk for severe complications from COVID-19, understanding patterns of worry may inform public health guidelines and interventions for this age group. We investigated older adults’ worry about COVID-19 in the early months of the pandemic and associations with familial/friend’s diagnosis or disease symptoms. Data comes from the baseline (April/May 2020), one-month, and two-month follow-up surveys from the COVID-19 Coping Study, a national longitudinal cohort study of US adults aged ≥55. We used linear regression models to investigate the association between self-reported familial/friend diagnosis or symptoms with pandemic worry, accounting for demographic factors and individual diagnosis or experience of COVID-19 symptoms. Participants (Baseline=4379, 1 month= 2553, 2 month=2682) were 67 years old on average, 72% were female, 5.7% were non-White, and 80.5% had a college degree. At baseline, 26.6% of participants had friends or family who had been diagnosed or experienced symptoms of COVID-19. Having friends or family diagnosed or with symptoms of COVID-19 (B=0.08, SE=0.04, p<.05), being female (B=0.42, SE=0.03, p<.001), and having higher educational attainment (B=0.06, SE=0.02, p<.001) were significantly associated with greater worry about COVID-19. These associations were consistent over 3 months. Understanding if worry about the pandemic correlates with following public health guidelines is a key next step so intervention strategies can prioritize older adults and their social networks.",2021-12-17,"Leggett, Amanda; Koo, Hyun Jung; Kobayashi, Lindsay; Finlay, Jessica; Lee, Hannah; Baker, Elaina",Innov Aging,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igab046.2744,245323045.0
hzp0861i,,WHO,Effect of COVID-19 epidemic on delay of diagnosis and treatment path for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma,,,,unk,"Introduction: 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks have been occurring in China and other countries in the world. To prevent further spread of the disease, restrictions of population flow from the government and measures to reduce virus transmission from hospitals may lead to the delay of diagnosis and treatment in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: All NPC patients with radiotherapy indications were included from 20 weekdays before (group A) and after (group B) January 31, 2020, when the institute began to take measures against COVID-19. The waiting intervals of each step and variation from the diagnosis and treatment path of NPC between two groups were compared. Results: Significant differences were found between the group A and group B in the median waiting days for pathological biopsy (5 vs 15, P=0.012), radiotherapy immobilization and simulation (3.5 vs 16.5, P&lt;0.001), validation of position and plan (20 vs 61, P&lt;0.001) and initiation of radiotherapy (28 vs 36, P=0.005). During the waiting period of radiotherapy, 32.4% of the NPC patients received an additional one cycle of chemotherapy to the original treatment strategy. Conclusion: The prevalence of COVID-19 caused delay in the diagnosis and treatment of NPC patients to a certain extent. Additional chemotherapy could be considered to counteract the effect of treatment delay. More specific measures should be taken to balance the risk of delayed diagnosis and treatment of NPC and infection of COVID-19.",2020,"Yang, Youqi; Shen, Chunying; Hu, Chaosu",Cancer Manage.

We compare mortality rates from In-Patient (IP) and Day Case (DC) trauma patients and compare the mortality rates of patients who tested positive or negative for Covid-19. METHOD: We reviewed all trauma admissions that underwent surgical intervention in both our IP and DC services during 31 days from March 23(rd) 2020. We recorded their sex, age, operation, Covid-19 symptoms, Covid-19 test results and mortality. The findings were compared between the groups. RESULTS: In total 127 patients underwent surgery (66 IP; 61 DC). There were 6 deaths (9.1%) within the IP group and 0 deaths in the DC group (p = 0.006).

A two-phase study was conducted to examine the performance of standardized tasks on a surgical simulator by novices during a distributed training period. Phase 1 examined the effect of LAP-specific or SIL-specific training on skill acquisition for both techniques. Phase 2 compared the effectiveness and learning curves of additional instrument types for SIL (straight [STR] vs. dynamic articulating [D-ART]). METHODS Medical students without previous surgical experience were randomized to LAP-specific training or SIL-specific training, using static articulating instruments [S-ART] for SIL. LAP and SIL scores on the peg transfer (PEG) and pattern cutting (CIRCLE) tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) were measured at baseline and after four training sessions. In phase 2, a new group of subjects were randomized to SIL training using STR or D-ART instruments, with similar baseline and post-training testing. FLS task scores were calculated and compared according to training regimen and instrument type. RESULTS Forty-five subjects completed the study. All scores improved significantly during the training period. Improvement in LAP score was similar between LAP-trained and SIL-trained groups. Improvement of SIL score was better for the SIL-trained group. Final scores were better and the learning curve was shorter for LAP versus SIL technique, with no differences in SIL scores according to instrument type. CONCLUSIONS LAP technique results in superior task performance with a shorter learning curve compared with SIL technique during a standardized training period. SIL-specific simulator training is better than LAP training alone to improve SIL performance. Neither S-ART nor D-ART instruments for SIL are associated with improved performance or shorter learning curve compared with STR instruments.",2011,"Santos, Byron F; Reif, Taylor J; Soper, Nathaniel J; Hungness, Eric S",Surgical endoscopy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1791-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21647813/,26301171.0

We apply a novel, high-resolution genotyping method, the ""varcode"" based on a single PCR to fingerprint the DBL region of the 40-60 members of the variant surface antigen-encoding var multigene family. Var genes are highly polymorphic within and between genomes, with var repertoires rapidly evolving by outcrossing during the obligatory sexual phase of P. falciparum in the mosquito. The continued incidence of clinical malaria after the outbreak in Ecuador provided a unique opportunity to use varcodes to document parasite microevolution and explore signatures of local disease transmission on the time scale of months to two years post-outbreak. We identified nine genetic varcodes circulating locally with spatiotemporal parasite genetic relatedness networks revealing that diversification of the clonal outbreak parasites by sexual recombination was associated with increased incidence of clinical episodes of malaria. Whether this was due to chance, immune selection or sexual recombination per se is discussed. Comparative analyses to other South American parasite populations where P. falciparum transmission remains endemic elucidated the possible origins of Ecuadorian varcodes. This analysis demonstrated that the majority of clinical cases were due to local transmission and not importation. Nonetheless, some of the varcodes that were unrelated to the outbreak varcode were found to be genetically related to other South American parasites.

However, studies on productive failure and retrieval practice have provided clear evidence against these two guidelines. In this article, issues with CLT and research inspired by this theory, which remain largely ignored among cognitive load theorists but have likely contributed to these contradictory findings, are discussed.

MATERIAL & METHODS: Twenty adult patients with slight-moderate chronic periodontitis received periodontal probing using controlled-force electronic probe at 2 visits. In visit 1, a random arch was probed with either a ball-end (0.6mm diameter, 408 kPa; Test) or straight (0.45mm diameter, 726 kPa; Control) probe tip. The opposing arch was then probed using the other probe tip. Discomfort associated with each probing episode was recorded using visual analogue scale (VAS). 7 days later, tip assignments were alternated from visit 1 and VAS re-scored. VAS scores were compared by probe tip, arches and visits. RESULTS: Both tips provided similar VAS scores (median 13.5 for ball-end and 14 for straight, p=0.3713). However, the straight tip was associated with decreased VAS scores in the maxilla (p=0.01). Overall, VAS values did not differ by arch or study visit. Individual VAS scores showed high levels of correlation between study visits and between tips used (R2 =0.86 and 0.64, respectively, P<0.0001).

Studies assessing the effectiveness of these new educational modalities should measure relevant outcomes using outcome measurement tools with validity evidence. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to determine the choice of outcomes, measurement instruments, and the use of measurement instruments with validity evidence in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of VR, AR, and MR in medical student education. METHODS: We conducted a systematic mapping review. We searched 7 major bibliographic databases from January 1990 to April 2020, and 2 reviewers screened the citations and extracted data independently from the included studies. We report our findings in line with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 126 retrieved RCTs, 115 (91.3%) were on VR and 11 (8.7%) were on AR. No RCT on MR in medical student education was found. Of the 115 studies on VR, 64 (55.6%) were on VR simulators, 30 (26.1%) on screen-based VR, 9 (7.8%) on VR patient simulations, and 12 (10.4%) on VR serious games. Most studies reported only a single outcome and immediate postintervention assessment data. Skills outcome was the most common outcome reported in studies on VR simulators (97%), VR patient simulations (100%), and AR (73%). Knowledge was the most common outcome reported in studies on screen-based VR (80%) and VR serious games (58%). Less common outcomes included participants’ attitudes, satisfaction, cognitive or mental load, learning efficacy, engagement or self-efficacy beliefs, emotional state, competency developed, and patient outcomes. At least one form of validity evidence was found in approximately half of the studies on VR simulators (55%), VR patient simulations (56%), VR serious games (58%), and AR (55%) and in a quarter of the studies on screen-based VR (27%). Most studies used assessment methods that were implemented in a nondigital format, such as paper-based written exercises or in-person assessments where examiners observed performance (72%). CONCLUSIONS: RCTs on VR and AR in medical education report a restricted range of outcomes, mostly skills and knowledge. The studies largely report immediate postintervention outcome data and use assessment methods that are in a nondigital format. Future RCTs should include a broader set of outcomes, report on the validity evidence of the measurement instruments used, and explore the use of assessments that are implemented digitally.",2022-04-13,"Tudor Car, Lorainne; Kyaw, Bhone Myint; Teo, Andrew; Fox, Tatiana Erlikh; Vimalesvaran, Sunitha; Apfelbacher, Christian; Kemp, Sandra; Chavannes, Niels",JMIR Serious Games,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9047880.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9047880/,

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.",2020,"Thompson, Robin N.; Lovell-Read, Francesca A.; Obolski, Uri",J. Clin.

RECENT FINDINGS In addition to trials that support the current Food and Drug Administration label and published over the past 3 years, the recently published Spironolactone With Patiromer in the Treatment of Resistant Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease (AMBER) trial provides clear benefits of patiromer use in a group of resistant hypertension patients. The AMBER was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 295 participants stratified by local serum potassium measurement (4.3 to < 4.7 mmol/L vs 4.7 to 5.1 mmol/L) and history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The focus was on enabling participants with resistant hypertension to achieve blood pressure goals by using spironolactone. Additionally, the ongoing Patiromer for the Management of Hyperkalemia in Subjects Receiving RAASi Medications for the Treatment of Heart Failure (DIAMOND) trial is designed to demonstrate how patiromer is an ""enabler"" of therapies that are needed to either control resistant hypertension or reduce mortality in heart failure but generate hyperkalemia.

In lieu of this, reports of elevated chitinase levels in ALS are interesting, as they are established surrogate markers of a chronic inflammatory response. While post-mortem studies have indicated glial expression, the cellular sources for these moieties remain to be fully understood. Therefore, the objective of this pilot study was to examine whether the peripheral immune system also contributes to chitinase dysregulation in ALS. The temporal expression of CHIT1, CHI3L1, and CHI3L2 in non-polarized monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMas) from ALS patients and healthy controls (HCs) was examined. We demonstrate that while CHIT1 and CHI3L1 display similar temporal expression dynamics in both groups, profound between-group differences were noted for these targets at later time-points i.e., when cells were fully differentiated.

Methods: A systematic search in PubMed and Embase for original studies presenting mathematical approaches using screening data. The studies were categorized by mathematical approach, data source and assumptions made. Furthermore, estimates of the duration of the preclinical detectable phase of breast and colorectal cancer were reported per study population. Results: From 689 publications, 34 estimation methods were included. Five distinct types of mathematical estimation approaches were identified: prevalence to incidence ratio (n=8), maximum likelihood estimation (n=16), expectation-maximization algorithm (n=1), regression of observed on expected (n=6) and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation (n=5). Fourteen studies used data of a screened and an unscreened population whereas nineteen studies included only information from a screened population. Estimates of the duration of the preclinical detectable phase varied between two and seven years for breast cancer within the HIP study (annual mammography and clinical breast examination in women aged 40-64 years) and two and five years for colorectal cancer within the Calvados study (one guaiac fecal occult blood test in men and women aged 45-74 years). Conclusion: Different types of mathematical approaches lead to different estimates of the duration of preclinical detectable phase.

Designing an automated classification system to detect pneumonia has become a worthwhile research topic. Numerous deep learning models have attempted to detect pneumonia by applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to X-ray radiographs, as they are essentially images and have achieved great performances. However, they failed to capture higher-order feature information of all objects based on the X-ray images because the topology of the X-ray images’ dimensions does not always come with some spatially regular locality properties, which makes defining a spatial kernel filter in X-ray images non-trivial. This paper proposes a principal neighborhood aggregation-based graph convolutional network (PNA-GCN) for pneumonia detection. In PNA-GCN, we propose a new graph-based feature construction utilizing the transfer learning technique to extract features and then construct the graph from images. Then, we propose a graph convolutional network with principal neighborhood aggregation. We integrate multiple aggregation functions in a single layer with degree-scalers to capture more effective information in a single layer to exploit the underlying properties of the graph structure. The experimental results show that PNA-GCN can perform best in the pneumonia detection task on a real-world dataset against the state-of-the-art baseline methods.",2022-04-15,"Guail, Akram Ali Ali; Jinsong, Gui; Oloulade, Babatounde Moctard; Al-Sabri, Raeed",Sensors (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/da284054400b6574e0626df0b9dc381b3c4b9b93.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9026930.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22083049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35459035/,248289024.0

Studies conducted in the age group of 18–60 years with a minimum sample size of 10, and statistically significant results were included. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in the review. They showed increase prevalence in nonpsychotic depression, preanxiety, somatic concerns, alcohol-related disorders, and insomnia in the general population. Psychological symptoms correlated more with physical complaints of fatigue and pain in older adults and were directly related to social media use, misinformation, xenophobia, and social distancing. Frontline workers reported guilt, stigma, anxiety, and poor sleep quality, which were related to the lack of availability of adequate personal protective equipment, increased workload, and discrimination. One study validated the Coronavirus anxiety scale in the Indian population while another explored gaming as a double-edged sword during the lockdown in adolescents. Another study from Bangladesh explored psychosexual health during lockdown. Most studies were cross-sectional online surveys, used screening tools and had limited accessibility.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Electronic patient records consisting of intraoral scans of the dentition, digital radiographs, photographs and written dental records were collected. Exercises in age estimations contained digital radiographs and photographs of ground tooth sections, with digital measuring tools and tables according to age groups. The teaching material was organised as a module in an electronic Learning Management System with external links to all relevant teaching material. RESULTS: For the identification exercises, intraoral scans and the latest digital radiographs simulated the postmortem examination of the deceased. For comparison, all other radiographs, photographs and dental records were available as antemortem material. The exercise was to match postmortem findings with the antemortem records using the Interpol standard and reconciliation. Age assessment of children used designated tables to grade tooth development on digital radiographs. For adults, non-destructive methods, digital radiographs, photographs and measuring tools were used. DISCUSSION: The teaching concept was hybrid, but it can easily be adapted as a fully digital exercise. The instructions and written material can be translated into different languages. The level of difficulty in the exercises can be adjusted according to the participant’s level of knowledge.

ds48moo4,,WHO,Reduced duration of stay after elective colorectal surgery during the peak phase of COVID-19 pandemic: A positive effect of infection risk awareness?,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: While elective surgery was shut down in most settings during the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic, some referral centers were designated as surgery hubs. We sought to investigate how the pandemic scenario impacted the quality of a long-established enhanced recovery protocol colorectal surgery program in 2 referral centers, designated as colorectal surgery hubs, located in the epicentral Italian regions hardest hit by the pandemic. METHODS: We compared short-term outcomes of patients undergoing major colorectal surgery with a long-established enhanced recovery protocol during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak occurred in 2020 (group A) with the correspondent timeframe of 2019 (group B). Primary outcomes were morbidity and mortality, duration of stay, and readmission rate. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six patients underwent major colorectal surgery in group A and 173 in group B. Postoperative complications and readmission rate were comparable between the 2 groups. Oncologic case-log was predominant in group A compared with group B (73.5 vs 61%; P = .01). A significantly shorter overall duration of stay was found in group A (P < .001). Uncomplicated patients of group A had a shorter duration of stay when compared with uncomplicated patients of group B (P = .008). CONCLUSION: Under special precautionary measures, major colorectal surgery can be undertaken on elective basis even during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic with reasonable results. A reduction of duration of stay within a long-established enhanced recovery protocol colorectal surgery program was observed during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic occurred in 2020 in comparison with the correspondent timeframe of the previous year without compromising short-term outcomes. The pandemic uncovered the positive impact of patients' commitment to reducing duration of stay as the empowered risk awareness likely promoted their compliance to the enhanced recovery protocol.",2021,"Spinelli, Antonino; Carvello, Michele; Carrano, Francesco Maria; Pasini, Francesco; Foppa, Caterina; Taffurelli, Giovanni; Ugolini, Giampaolo; Montroni, Isacco",Surgery,,#covidwho-1131835,,,,,229364347.0
vabpbvew,,WHO,Single center trends in acute coronary syndrome volume and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic,,,,unk,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly affected healthcare delivery across the world. In this report, we aim to further characterize the changes in cardiac catheterization at our institution, specifically in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization between December 23, 2019 and April 12, 2020 at our institution. All patients with cardiac catheterizations for ACS, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) activation, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) were analyzed. Cardiac catheterization volume, as well as clinical and procedural characteristics of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, was compared before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Patients presenting with ACS and OHCA were similar in terms of demographics and comorbidities during both time periods. The mean monthly volume for ACS cases dropped by 26% during the pandemic, which was consistent among both unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and STEMI cases. OHCA volume decreased significantly as well (five cases per month before to zero cases during the pandemic, P = 0.01). Among patients with STEMI, initial markers of cardiac injury, door-to-balloon time, and all-cause mortality were similar in both time periods. Conclusions: With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in cardiac catheterization volume across the spectrum of ACS at our institution, which was consistent with reports from other centers across the globe. Patients with STEMI during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic did not seem to have delays in presentation or significant differences in all-cause mortality at our institution.",2020,"Tan, Weiyi; Parikh, Rushi V.; Chester, Rebecca; Harrell, Jeffrey; Franco, Vanessa; Aksoy, Olcay; Dave, Ravi; Rafique, Asim; Press, Marcella",Cardiol.

Users approach the emergence of and participation in these platforms driven by a range of motivations. It is essential to characterise the different forms of participation in services such as Twitch to evaluate the phenomenon and reflect on its advantages and disadvantages. To that end, a survey was carried out of 580 young people and adolescents aged between 14 and 24. The aim of this study is thus to explore the uptake of these platforms, as well as identify user groups, distinguish between different motivations, and address the associated benefits and harms. Applying a methodology based on factor analysis and cluster analysis, user profiles were characterised according to their specific features, gaming/viewing hours, self-perception of their skill level as a player, devices used, and type or genre of video game. Four subgroups of gamers/viewers were thus identified: casual, social, hobby, and problematic. The results showed that older users and female users feature more prominently in the first two groups, as do those spending less time on video games and live streaming platforms. Conversely, in the hobby and problematic groups, we observe just the opposite.

In response, many governments denied entry to travellers arriving from various countries affected by the virus. While several industries continue to experience economic losses due to the imposed interventions, it is unclear whether the different travel restrictions were successful in reducing COVID-19 importations. Methods: Here we develop a comprehensive framework to model daily COVID-19 importations, considering different travel bans. We quantify the temporal effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations into the country under investigation. As a cases study, we evaluate the travel bans enforced by the Australian government.Findings: We find that international travel bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 85.36% (80.41 - 89.9) between January and May 2020.

METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted, lasting for 31 months, including the start of the pandemic. Frequency of BD and the use of obstetric emergency services was observed. RESULTS: A direct relationship was observed between the pandemic and a decrease in BD. Although emergency obstetric visits decreased, the frequency of deliveries and cases of PPH remained unchanged. After applying strategies to promote voluntary BD, a very slight increase was observed in the frequency of BD, with a negative indicator persisting between donation and blood demand. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to shortages at BBs. In this context, typical measures to encourage an altruistic attitude toward BD have not had a significant impact. As causes of PPH continue, quality of care may be affected by the current situation at BBs.

Presently, the entire world faces a challenging crisis of ""Severe Acute Respiratory Diseases Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as the COVID-19 pandemic"". The impact of vaccines at national levels to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths are unclear, and people have concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines in real-world settings. This study's objective was to examine the effect of the ""Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca"" vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we collected data on SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths from the date of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Saudi Arabia March 2, 2020, to the date of launching the vaccination campaign on December 14, 2020; and from December 15, 2020, to September 8, 2021. We recorded the World Health Organization data and Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia to evaluate the impact of the ""Pfizer/BioNTech, (BNT162b2 mRNA) and Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZD1222)"" vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths before and after the vaccination campaign in Saudi Arabia. RESULTS Saudi Arabia launched the ""Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca"" vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 on December 14, 2020. In Saudi Arabia, before the vaccination campaign from March 2, 2020, to December 14, 2020, the mean daily SARS-CoV-2 cases were 1235.60, daily deaths were 22.70, that significantly reduced (p=0.0001) compared to the period after the vaccination campaign from December 15, 2020, to September 8, 2021, in which the daily cases fell to 692.08, and daily deaths fell to 9.48 (p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In Saudi Arabia, Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccinations significantly reduced the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths after the vaccination compared to the period before the vaccination campaign at country levels.

Methods Surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1000 mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant . Air and sewage disinfection was proceeded routinely and strictly. Hospital environmental surfaces and PPE of staffs in isolation wards were sampled using swabs. The sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled. The respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected. The respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods were used to confirm the existence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Viral culture was done for the samples positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Results During the study period, 33 laboratory-confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital. None of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staffs PPE samples in isolation wards. Though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection pool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection pool was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative.

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a prospective monocentric, randomized, quadruple-blinded and placebo-controlled superiority trial. This phase 3 clinical study is based on two parallel groups received either intravenous lidocaine 2% or intravenous NaCl 0.9%. PARTICIPANTS: This study has been conducted at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg (medical and surgical Intensive Care Units in Hautepierre Hospital) since the 4th November 2020. The participants are 18 years-old and older, hospitalized in ICU for a moderate to severe ARDS according to the Berlin definition; they have to be intubated and sedated for mechanical protective ventilation. All participants are affiliated to the French Social security system and a dosage of beta HCG has to be negative for women of child bearing age . For the Covid-19 subgroup, the SARS-CoV2 infection is proved by RT-PCR <7 days before admission and/or another approved diagnostic technique and/or typical CT appearance pneumonia. The data are prospectively collected in e-Case Report Forms and extracted from clinical files. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The participants are randomised in two parallel groups with a 1:1 ratio. In the experimental group, patients receive intravenous lidocaine 2% (20mg/mL) (from FRESENIUS KABI France); the infusion protocol provide a bolus of 1 mg/kg (ideal weight), followed by 3 mg/kg/h for the first hour, 1.5 mg/kg/h for the second hour, 0.72 mg/kg/h for the next 22 hours and then 0.6 mg/kg/h for 14 days at most or 24 hours after extubation or ventilator-weaning. The patients in the control group receive intravenous NaCl 0.9% (9 mg/mL) (from Aguettant, France) as placebo comparator; the infusion protocol provide a bolus of 0.05 mL/kg (ideal weight), followed by 0.15 mL/kg/h for the first hour, 0.075 mL/kg/h for the second hour, 0.036 mL/kg/h for the next 22 hours, and the 0.03 mL/kg/h for up to 14 days or 24 hours after extubation or ventilator-weaning. Lidocaine level is assessed at H4, D2, D7 and D14 to prevent local anesthetics systemic toxicity. Clinical data and biological samples are collected to assess disease progression. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the evolution of alveolar-capillary gas exchange measured by the PaO2/FiO2 ratio after two days of treatment. The secondary endpoints of the study include the following: Evolution of PaO2/FiO2 ratio at admission and after 21 days of treatment Number of ventilator-free days Anti-inflammatory effects by dosing inflammatory markers at different timepoints (ferritin, bicarbonate, CRP, PCT, LDH, IL-6, Troponin HS, triglycerides, complete blood count, lymphocytes) Anti-thrombotic effects by dosing platelets, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-dimers, viscoelastic testing and identification of all thromboembolic events up to 4 weeks. Plasmatic concentration of lidocaine and albumin Incidence of adverse events like cardiac rhythm disorders, need of vasopressors, any modification of the QRS, QTc or PR intervals every day Ileus recovery time Consumption of hypnotics, opioids, neuromuscular blockers. Lengths of stay in the ICU, incidence of reintubation and complications due to intensive care unit care (mortality until 90 days, pneumothorax, bacterial pneumopathy, bronchospasm, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, need of renal dialysis, delirium, atrial fibrillation, stroke (CAM-ICU score), tetraplegia (MCR score)). Incidence of cough and sore throat at extubation or ventilator-weaning and within 24 hours. All these outcomes will be evaluated according to positivity to Sars-Cov-2.

However, asymptomatic infection has also been reported, highlighting the difference in immune responses among individuals. Here we performed single-cell chromatin accessibility and T cell-receptor analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19 and healthy donors. Chromatin remodelling was observed in both innate and adaptive immune cells in the individuals convalescing from COVID-19. Compared with healthy donors, recovered individuals contained abundant TBET-enriched CD16+ and IRF1-enriched CD14+ monocytes with sequential trained and activated epigenomic states. The B-cell lineage in recovered individuals exhibited an accelerated developmental programme from immature B cells to antibody-producing plasma cells. Finally, an integrated analysis of single-cell T cell-receptor clonality with the chromatin accessibility landscape revealed the expansion of putative SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells with epigenomic profiles that promote the differentiation of effector or memory cells. Overall, our data suggest that immune cells of individuals convalescing from COVID-19 exhibit global remodelling of the chromatin accessibility landscape, indicative of the establishment of immunological memory.",2021,"You, Maojun; Chen, Liang; Zhang, Dawei; Zhao, Peng; Chen, Zhu; Qin, En-Qiang; Gao, Yanan; Davis, Mark M; Yang, Pengyuan",Nat Cell Biol,,#covidwho-1263492,,,,,235393474.0

However, controlled clinical study procedures have evolved substantially since then. We performed a trial using updated methods to evaluate the efficacy of Lantigen B®, a chemical BL. This double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center clinical trial had the primary objective of assessing the capacity of Lantigen B to significantly reduce the total number of infectious episodes in patients with RRTI. Secondary aims were the RRTI duration, the frequency and the severity of the acute episodes, the use of drugs and the number of missed workdays. In the subgroup of allergic patients with RRTI, the number of allergic episodes (AE) and the use of anti-allergic drugs were also evaluated. One hundred and sixty patients, 79 allocated to the treated group (TG) and 81 to the placebo group (PG), were enrolled; 30 were lost during the study and 120 (79 females and 38 males) were evaluated. The PG had 1.43 episodes in the 8-months of follow-up while the TG had 0.86 episodes (p =0.036). A similar result was observed in the allergic patients (1.80 and 0.86 episodes for the PG and the TG, respectively, p =0.047). The use of antibiotics was reduced (mean 1.24 and 2.83 days of treatment for the TG and the PG). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the estimated risk of needing antibiotics and NSAIDs was reduced by 52.1 and 30.6%, respectively. With regard to the number of AE, no significant difference was observed between the two groups, but bronchodilators, antihistamines and local corticosteroids were reduced by 25.7%, 56.2% and 41.6%, respectively, in the TG.

Our study aimed to determine the risk factors of death and severe illness requiring supplemental oxygen therapy based on the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Korea. METHODS: In this study, we used data provided by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) and analyzed a total of 5,068 patients with COVID-19, excluding 19 pregnant women and 544 individuals with missing data. We performed logistic regression analysis to determine the impact of early symptoms on survival and severe disease. Logistic regression models included sex, age, number of comorbidities, symptoms on admission, blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature as explanatory variables, and death and oxygen therapy as outcome variables. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses revealed that the male sex, older age (&#8805; 60 years), higher number of comorbidities, presence of symptoms on admission, heart rate &#8805; 120 bpm, and body temperature &#8805; 37.5°C presented with higher risk of in-hospital death and oxygen therapy requirement. Conversely, rhinorrhea and headache were associated with a low risk of death and oxygen therapy requirement. The findings showed that cough, sputum, and fever were the most common symptoms on admission, while 25.3% of patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic.

However, whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection interferes with females’ fertility and causes different symptoms among pregnant and non-pregnant females remains unknown. Here, we examined the differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers, proinflammatory cytokines, and levels of T cell activation after SARS-CoV-2 sub-lethal infection between pregnant and non-pregnant human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II (ACE2) transgenic mouse models. Both mice showed elevated levels of viral loads in the lung at 4 days post-infection (dpi). However, viral loads in the pregnant group remained elevated at 7 dpi while decreased in the non-pregnant group. Consistent with viral loads, increased production of proinflammatory cytokines was detected from the pregnant group, and the IgM or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody in serum of pregnant mice featured delayed elevation compared with non-pregnant mice. Moreover, by accessing kinetics of activation marker expression of peripheral T cells after infection, a lower level of CD8(+) T cell activation was observed in pregnant mice, further demonstrating the difference of immune-response between pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Although vertical transmission did not occur as SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in the uterus and fetus from the infected pregnant mice, a lower pregnancy rate was observed when the mice were infected before embryo implantation after mating, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection may interfere with mice’s fertility at a specific time window.

DESIGN: Single centre cohort study. SETTING: Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei province, China. POPULATION: We studied 13 SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women diagnosed between 31 January and 9 March 2020. METHODS: We collected clinical data, vaginal secretions, stool specimens and breast milk from SARS-CoV-2-infected women during different stages of pregnancy and collected neonatal throat and anal swabs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We assessed viral presence in different biosamples. RESULTS: Of the 13 women with COVID-19, five were in their first trimester, three in their second trimester and five in their third trimester. Of the five women in their third trimester who gave birth, all delivered live newborns. Among these five deliveries, the primary adverse perinatal outcomes included premature delivery (n = 2) and neonatal pneumonia (n = 2). One of nine stool samples was positive; all 13 vaginal secretion samples, and five throat swabs and four anal swabs collected from neonates, were negative for the novel coronavirus. However, one of three samples of breast milk was positive by viral nucleic acid testing.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a tireless effort to understand the sequelae of the virus. A 46-year-old woman who presented after a COVID-19 hospitalization complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation for 23 days was subsequently found to have lower extremity sensorium changes as well as upper extremity weakness. Left shoulder abduction and extension were both 3/5 in motor strength and left hip flexion strength was 4/5 with diminished sensation to crude touch in the left lateral thigh. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (NCS/EMG) findings included a mild left median neuropathy at the wrist, and motor unit recruitment pattern consistent with a chronic left upper trunk plexopathy with re-innervation. The case presented describes an extended neuralgic amyotrophy syndrome (ENAS) from an atraumatic mechanism in a previously diagnosed COVID-19 patient. ENAS has at least three immune mediated etiologies postulated 1) direct neuropathogenicity 2) molecular mimicry and 3) direct cytotoxic effects on peripheral nerves. As COVID-19 survivors continue to be seen in outpatient settings, practitioners should remain aware of diffuse neurological complications as sequelae of the virus persist.",2021,"Alvarez, Armando; Amirianfar, Edwin; Mason, Marisa Carino; Huang, Laura; Jose, Jean; Tiu, Timothy",Am. j. phys. med. rehabilit,,#1232243,,,,,234770899.0

The modifications ensure an increased molecular and functional diversity at protein- and peptide-level. Prohormones are small pro-proteins that are expressed in many cell types, for instance endocrine cells, immune cells, myocytes and neurons. Here they mature to bioactive peptides (cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters) that are released from the cells in an often regulated manner. The posttranslational processing of prohormones is cell-specific, however, and may vary during evolution and disease. Therefore, it is often inadequate to measure just a single peptide fragment as marker of endocrine, immune, and neuronal functions. In order to meet this challenge, we developed years back a simple ""processing-independent analysis"" (PIA) for accurate quantification of the total pro-protein product - irrespective of the degree and nature of the posttranslational processing.

While Research Ethics Committees monitor fair subject selection within each trial, no standard oversight exists for subject selection across multiple trials for the same disease. Drawing on the experience of multiple clinical trials at a single academic medical centre in the USA, we posit that concurrent COVID-19 trials are liable to unfair and inequitable subject selection on account of scientific uncertainty, lack of transparency, scarcity and, lastly, structural barriers to equity compounded by implicit bias. To address the critical gap in the current literature and international regulation, we propose new ethical guidelines for research design and conduct that bolsters fair and equitable subject selection.

In this study, we initiated callus cultures from healthy stem explants in the presence of iron-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles (Fe-ZnO-NPs). We performed experiments with the callus cultures of F. indica to determine the impact of Fe-ZnO-NPs in concentrations (15.62–250 µg/mL) on biomass accumulation, production of important phenolic and flavonoids, and antioxidative potential. Our results showed that maximum callus biomass [Fresh weight (FW) = 13.6 g and Dry weight (DW) = 0.58 ± 0.01] was produced on day 40 when the media was supplemented with 250 μg/mL Fe-ZnO-NPs. Similarly, maximum total phenolic content (268.36 μg GAE/g of DW) was observed in 40 days old callus added with 125 μg/mL Fe-ZnO-NPs. Maximum total flavonoid content (78.56 μg QE/g of DW) was recorded in 20 days old callus grown in 62.5 μg/mL Fe-ZnO-NPs containing media. Maximum total antioxidant capacity (390.74 µg AAE/g of DW) was recorded in 40 days old callus with 125 μg/mL Fe-ZnO-NPs treated cultures, respectively. Similarly, the highest free radical scavenging activity (93.02%) was observed in callus derived from media having 15.62 µg/mL Fe-ZnO-NPs. The antioxidant potential was observed to have positive correlation with TPC (r = 0.44). HPLC analysis showed that Fe-ZnO-NPs produced compounds (e.g., Epigallocatechin gallate) that were either absent or in lesser quantities in the control group. These results showed that Fe-ZnO-NPs elicitors could increase the biomass and activate secondary metabolism in F. indica cells.

We assess vaccine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in several animal models. Vaccine candidate YF-S0 has an outstanding safety profile and induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in hamsters, mice and cynomolgus macaques and concomitantly a protective immunity against YFV. Humoral immunity is complemented by a favourable Th1 cell-mediated immune response as profiled in mice. In a stringent hamster model2 as well as in non-human primates, YF-S0 prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2.

These had made them vulnerable to various infectious agents, with many reports of morbidity and mortality also being evident. Objectives: The current study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 among community pharmacists in Gondar town, Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A structured, self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection, and the collected data were coded, validated, and analyzed using SPSS version 26. Quantitative data were summarized using means and standard deviations, while frequencies and proportions were used to summarize categorical data. A chi-square test was used to assess an association between the different variables, and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to declare statistical significance at a 95% confidence interval. Results: A total of 46 community pharmacy professionals had participated in the study. The main sources of information about COVID-19 were news media 29 (63%), followed by social media 24 (52.2%). The mean knowledge score was 8.15 (standard deviation: 1.86), and among the total study participants, 29 (63%) were found to have good knowledge about COVID-19. The mean attitude score was 31.52 (standard deviation: 4.288). Only 30.4% of the study participants were found to have a good practice toward the prevention of COVID-19. Chi-square results showed that having a good knowledge of COVID-19 was significantly associated with practice (P = 0.035).

In the emergency setting new or available therapies to contrast the spread of COVID-19 are urgently needed. Elderly males, especially those affected by previous diseases or with comorbidities, are more prone to develop interstitial pneumonia that can deteriorate evolving to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) that require hospitalization in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Even children and young patients are not spared by SARS-CoV 2 infection, yet they seem to develop a milder form of disease. In this setting the immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D, should be further investigated. METHODS: We reviewed the literature about the immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D collecting data from the databases Medline and Embase. RESULTS: Vitamin D proved to interact both with the innate immune system, by activating Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or increasing the levels of cathelicidins and ß-defensins, and adaptive immune system, by reducing immunoglobulin secretion by plasma cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines production, thus modulating T cells function. Promising results have been extensively described as regards the supplementation of vitamin D in respiratory tract infections, autoimmune diseases and even pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we suggest that vitamin D supplementation might play a role in the prevention and/or treatment to SARS-CoV-2 infection disease, by modulating the immune response to the virus both in the adult and pediatric population.",2020,"Panfili, F M; Roversi, M; D039,; Argenio, P; Rossi, P; Cappa, M; Fintini, D",J. endocrinol. invest,,#601171,,,,,219730945.0

The facility is related to the possession of the required tools and knowledge to utilize the technology, alongside the significant effect on ease of use and usefulness. When adequately provided, the ease and benefit of using Google Classroom are maximally felt when distance learning is ongoing. Consequently, the ease of use positively influenced the benefits of the platform as its features were simple and benefited the students during the learning process. The usefulness of Google Classroom also had a positive influence on attitude towards the platform, and this variable finally determined the intention to use, which was significantly influenced by the perceived usefulness of e-learning.

From the analysis of the materials used, as well as of the production methods, it was found that a compliant surgical mask is most likely composed of three layers, a central meltblown filtration layer and two external spunbond comfort layers. An increase in the material thickness (grammage), or in the number of layers, does not improve the filtration efficiency, but leads to poor breathability, indicating that filtration depends not only on pure size exclusion, but other mechanisms are taking place (driven by electrostatic charge).

qlx41b52,,WHO,2019 Chinese clinical guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma: updates and insights,,,,unk,"Importance: Approximately half of newly-diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases in the world occur in China, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection being the predominant risk factor. Recently, the guidelines for the management of Chinese HCC patients were updated. Objective: The past decade has witnessed a great improvement in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study reviews the recommendations in the 2019 Chinese guidelines and makes comparison with the practices from the Western world. Evidence Review: The updated recommendations on the surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment algorithm of HCC in the 2019 Chinese guidelines were summarized, and comparisons among the updated Chinese guidelines, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines were made. Findings: Besides imaging and pathological diagnoses, novel biomarkers like the seven-micro-RNA panel are advocated for early diagnoses and therapeutic efficacy evaluation in the updated Chinese guidelines. The China liver cancer (CNLC) staging system, proposed in the 2017 guidelines, continues to be the standard model for patient classification, with subsequent modifications and updates being made in treatment allocations. Compared to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system, the CNLC staging system employs resection, transplantation, and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for more progressed HCC. TACE in combination with other regional therapies like ablation or with systemic therapies like sorafenib are also encouraged in select patients in China.

However, despite its high pathogenicity and transmissibility, the severity of the associated disease, COVID-19, varies widely. While the prognosis is favorable in most patients, critical illness, manifested by respiratory distress, thromboembolism, shock, and multi-organ failure, has been reported in about 5% of cases. Several studies have associated poor COVID-19 outcomes with the exhaustion of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, lymphopenia, and elevated serum levels of D-dimer. In this article, we propose a common pathophysiological denominator for these negative prognostic markers, endogenous, angiotensin II toxicity. We hypothesize that, like in avian influenza, the outlook of COVID-19 is negatively correlated with the intracellular accumulation of angiotensin II promoted by the viral blockade of its degrading enzyme receptors. In this model, upregulated angiotensin II causes premature vascular senescence, leading to dysfunctional coagulation, and immunity. We further hypothesize that angiotensin II blockers and immune checkpoint inhibitors may be salutary for COVID-19 patients with critical illness by reversing both the clotting and immune defects (Graphical Abstract).",2020-06-19,"Sfera, Adonis; Osorio, Carolina; Jafri, Nyla; Diaz, Eddie Lee; Campo Maldonado, Jose E.",Front Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e91f5a8d79d9312fc57504d02fac371512f12f7d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7325923.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32655579/,219845403.0

Tous les départements français ont ouvert des unités dédiées pour la gestion de la phase aiguë de l’épidémie. Au sein de notre site, notre structure a été la seule à accueillir une unité pour gérer des patients confirmés COVID-19 positifs. En l’absence de soins intensifs sur place, ces patients étaient triés au SAU et ne venaient que les patients sans indication de soins intensifs en raison du bénéfice/risque attendu (âge, comorbidités). Pour activer cette unité, une équipe mutualisée a été mise en place que ce soit au niveau du personnel médical PM (seniors, internes, externes) que personnel non médical (PNM) détachés des services de médecine interne, pédiatrie, médecine du sport, consultation, endocrinologie, hépatologie de notre CHU. Un support psychologique a été proposé aux soignants et aux familles par une équipe mobile de psychiatrie. L’activité quotidienne a été réorganisée après la création de plusieurs binômes junior-senior, en service de 8h à 19h, 7 j/7. La continuité des soins a été assurée chaque jour par 3 staffs pour permettre respectivement les transmissions de la nuit entre PM et PNM ; l’état des lieux après la visite du matin ; les projets pour le lendemain. Tous les patients ont été réévalués chaque jour et réorientés selon une échelle de gravité structurée par 5 codes-couleurs. Les externes ont eu pour mission de contacter les familles du fait de la limitation des visites, ainsi que les médecins traitants afin d’améliorer la gestion après le RAD. Les patients ont été traités par oxygénothérapie et protocoles d’antibiothérapie et morphine.

Résultats Entre le 13 mars et le 19 mai, 147 patients, 56 % d’eux de sexe féminin, ont été hospitalisés dans cette unité d’une capacité maximale de 25 lits. L’âge moyen était de 69 ans [18 ; 97]. La durée moyenne du séjour a été de 5jours [0 : 29]. La mortalité totale était du 20,4 %, dont 51 % des patients sont rentrés vers leur domicile ou vers des EHPAD. Ensuite, 14,3 % des patients ont été transférés vers un autre service de médecine aiguë, et 12,2 % des patients a poursuit les soins dans un SSR. Conclusion L’organisation de ce service montre comme une équipe de PM et PNM avec fonds de travail différentes peut être rapidement mise en place pendant une période de crise. La présence d’un service dédié à la gestion des cas de COVID-19 sans indication à soins intensifs peut soulager des autres services au sein d‘un groupe hospitalier qui travaille en coordination.

Objective: To compare chest CT features of COVID-19, influenza, and OP using a multireader design, and to assess radiologists' performance in distinguishing between these conditions. Methods: This retrospective study included 150 chest CT examinations in 150 patients (mean age 58±16 years) with diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or non-infectious OP (50 randomly selected abnormal CT examinations per diagnosis). Six thoracic radiologists independently assessed CT examinations for 14 individual CT findings and Radiologic Society of North America (RSNA) COVID-19 category and recorded a favored diagnosis. CT characteristics of the three diagnoses were compared using random effects models; readers' diagnostic performance was assessed. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly different (p<.05) from influenza pneumonia for seven of 14 chest CT findings, though different (p<.05) from OP for 4 of 14 findings [central or diffuse distribution in 10% and 7% of COVID-19 vs 20% and 21% of OP; unilateral distribution in 1% of COVID-19 vs 7% of OP; non-tree-in-bud nodules in 32% of COVID-19 vs 53% of OP; tree-in-bud nodules in 6% of COVID-19 vs 14% of OP]. A total of 70% of cases of COVID-19, 33% of influenza, and 47% of OP had an RSNA COVID-19 category of typical (p<.001). Mean percentage of correct favored diagnoses compared to actual diagnoses was 44% for COVID-19, 29% for influenza, and 39% for OP. Mean diagnostic accuracy of favored diagnoses was 70% for COVID-19 pneumonia and 68% for both influenza and OP. Conclusion: CT findings of COVID-19 substantially overlap with influenza and, to a greater extent, with OP. Radiologists' diagnostic accuracy was low in a study sample containing equal proportions of these three types of pneumonia. Clinical Impact: Recognized challenges in diagnosing COVID-19 by CT are furthered by our observed strong overlap between CT appearances of COVID-19 and OP.

This Editorial highlights a study by Aliu and colleagues in the current issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry, in which the investigators constructed a biodegradable poly‐l‐lysine backbone with multiple copies of this sulfated HNK‐1 trisaccharide. This decoy, poly(phenyl disodium 3‐O‐sulfo‐β‐d‐glucopyranuronate)‐(1→3)‐β‐d‐galactopyranoside, known as PPSGG, removed anti‐MAG IgM autoantibodies from the blood, while not activating the immune system. These findings provide a path for the selective removal of a pathogenic set of antibodies that target the myelin sheath resulting in neuropathy. These findings are applicable to a parallel strategy for the generation of polysaccharides similar to those present in the receptor‐binding domain of CoViD‐19, which might inhibit viral adhesion to its receptor, the angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2) protein, thereby impairing cellular uptake of the virus itself. The deployment of complex polysaccharides that mimic actual COVID19 polysaccharides on the spike protein may also provide a feasible structural basis for a vaccine. Carbohydrate mimics, if conjugated to a carrier or backbone, might provoke an immune response to the spike protein. A vaccine that targets critical carbohydrates on COVID19, and then neutralizes the virus would recapitulate a successful strategy employed in other microbial vaccines, like the pneumococcal vaccines and the meningococcal vaccines. These vaccines direct an immune response to complex carbohydrates and successfully prevent life‐threatening disease. This paper provides lessons from a rare neurologic disease that may teach us strategies applicable to a global pandemic.

FSOC is the degree to which a family perceives family life as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have used this scale, and very few have evaluated FSOC Scale psychometric properties. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the original FSOC Scale in a sample of Portuguese caregivers of children aged between 10 and 15 years. Methods: A total of 329 caregivers completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and the FSOC Scale. Analyses were performed to evaluate the factor structure of the FSOC Scale with 26 items as well as composite reliability, internal consistency, convergent-related validity, and discriminant-related validity of the scale scores. Results: The findings supported a three-factor solution for a 13-item version that maintains the original FSOC Scale structure. The three FSOC dimensions presented a good fit to the data. Cronbach’s alpha, composite reliability, and convergent-related validity were considered very good for the FSOC Scale (α = 0.956; CR = 0.974; AVE = 0.689). No evidence of discriminant-related validity was found for the dimensions of FSOC. Conclusion: The findings support the use of the Portuguese FSOC Scale for research and clinical purposes with Portuguese caregivers. Future research is necessary to further develop a European Portuguese version of the FSOC Scale. Implications: This study provides a psychometric evaluation of FSOC Scale characteristics in a Portuguese sample. The results are helpful for clinicians and family therapists who work with families since it could help them to assess the resources of families and their ability to cope with adversity and enhance their strengths.",2022-01-13,"Carneiro, Francis Anne T.; Salvador, Vanessa F.; Costa, Pedro A.; Leal, Isabel P.",Front Psychol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7d20fdec5599fa1795f71350d738fc2f23737817.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8793481.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.762357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35095647/,245882664.0

ABO blood types have been associated with disease susceptibility; however, evidence remains limited. Our aim was to determine the association between ABO/Rh blood type with disease susceptibility and mortality among admitted COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 requiring admission was undertaken. Demographics and pertinent medical history were analyzed with respect to ABO/Rh blood type: between the cases and a control population; as well as with respect to mortality in the COVID-19 population in univariate analysis. Potential confounding factors were evaluated by multivariate models. The main outcomes were disease susceptibility by comparison of blood type prevalence between populations, and mortality within the COVID-19 population. RESULTS: A total of 825 cases (admitted with confirmed COVID-19 infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)) and 396 controls (seen at the same institution during the calendar year of 2019) were included. The COVID-19 population was older with male predominance. It was heavily represented by blood types O-positive (53%) and A-positive (23%), while lower representation was observed in groups B-positive (odds ratio (OR): 0.61, P = 0.013) and AB-positive (OR: 0.46, P = 0.014). Neither relationship remained significant in pairwise analysis. Within the COVID-19 population, no mortality difference was appreciated between ABO groups (P = 0.312), but higher mortality was observed in Rh negative group (P = 0.01). The latter of which was significantly confounded by age (P < 0.001), sex (P = 0.022), body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.001), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (P < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: While type A blood appears to be weakly more prevalent with respect to B and AB types in hospitalized patients, strong confounders of age and sex dilute this significance. Rh-negative patients appear to have a higher mortality, although this too is strongly confounded. Overall, ABO and Rh blood types do not have a significant relationship with susceptibility and mortality with COVID-19 infection in our population.",2020-12-18,"Bhandari, Priyanka; Durrance, Richard Jesse; Bhuti, Penpa; Salama, Carlos",J Clin Med Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/21a3dfdab220bc7fb8526558d560e2d416e807de.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7781279.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.14740/jocmr4382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447315/,231593249.0

To rapidly detect the presence of foodborne pathogens, conventional PCR assays are currently widely employed. Meanwhile, isothermal PCR methods, in which the amplification reactions take place at a low and constant temperature, have lately emerged as effective and alternative means for quickly identifying pathogens in low-resource settings. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are two of the most concerning foodborne bacterial infections. In this work, an isothermal PCR assay based on the Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) method was developed to simultaneously detect S. aureus and P. aeruginosa with high sensitivity and specificity. The limit of detection for multiplex RPA was 10 and 30 fg/reaction of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa genomic DNA, respectively. Furthermore, the reaction time was reduced to only 25 minutes, with a low incubation temperature of 39°C. Multiplex RPA reactions, in particular, were successful in directly identifying as low as 1 and 5 CFU/reaction of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa cells, respectively, without the need for DNA genome extraction. Moreover, the multiplex RPA reliably detected the two foodborne bacteria in milk, fruit juice, and bottled water samples. In conclusion, the direct multiplex RPA reported in this work offers a quick, easy, sensitive, and effective alternative approach for detecting the presence of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa without the requirement of a pricey instrument or highly-trained personnel.",2022-03-03,"Tran, Diem Hong; Tran, Hau Thi; Pham, Trang Nguyen Minh; Phung, Huong Thi Thu",Mol Biol Res Commun,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f961c87348184e4fc96d3b02e5594683d97b6396.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9012432.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35463821/; https://doi.org/10.22099/mbrc.2021.41503.1664,248344880.0

In fact a detector, associated with a frame which is affected by the shock, can not be trivial in terms of its response.

A panel of 10 plasma metabolites effectively distinguished COVID-19 patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.975). Plasma lipidome of COVID-19 resembled that of monosialodihexosyl ganglioside (GM3)-enriched exosomes, with enhanced levels of sphingomyelins (SMs) and GM3s, and reduced diacylglycerols (DAGs). Systems evaluation of metabolic dysregulation in COVID-19 was performed using multiscale embedded differential correlation network analyses. Using exosomes isolated from the same cohort, we demonstrated that exosomes of COVID-19 patients with elevating disease severity were increasingly enriched in GM3s.

bxwb8ean,,WHO,Maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of birth in England: national cohort study,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of birth and maternal and perinatal outcomes. METHODS: This is a population-based cohort study in England. The inclusion criteria were women with a recorded singleton birth between 29th May 2020 and 31st January 2021 in a national database of hospital admissions. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between pregnant women with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded in the birth episode and those without. Study outcomes were fetal death at or beyond 24 weeks' gestation (stillbirth), preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation), small for gestational age infant (SGA; birthweight <10th centile), preeclampsia/eclampsia, induction of labor, mode of birth, specialist neonatal care, composite neonatal adverse outcome indicator, maternal and neonatal length of hospital stay following birth (3 days or more), 28-day neonatal and 42-day maternal hospital readmission. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection status and outcomes were calculated using logistic regression, adjusting for maternal age, ethnicity, parity, pre-existing diabetes, pre-existing hypertension and socioeconomic deprivation measured using Index of Multiple Deprivation 2019. Models were fitted with robust standard errors to account for hospital-level clustering. The analysis of the neonatal outcomes was repeated for those born at term (&#8805; 37 weeks' gestation) since preterm birth has been reported to be more common in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The analysis included 342,080 women, of whom 3,527 had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was more common in women who were younger, of non-white ethnicity, primiparous, residing in the most deprived areas, or had comorbidities. Fetal death (aOR, 2.21, 95% CI 1.58-3.11; P<0.001) and preterm birth (aOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.96-2.42; P<0.001) occurred more frequently in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection than those without. Risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.29-1.85; P<0.001), birth by emergency Cesarean delivery (aOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.51-1.76; P<0.001) and prolonged admission following birth (aOR 1.57, 95%CI 1.44-1.72; P<0.001) were significantly higher for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection than those without. There were no significant differences in the rate of other maternal outcomes. Risk of neonatal adverse outcome (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.27-1.66; P<0.001), need for specialist neonatal care (aOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51; P=0.03), and prolonged neonatal admission following birth (aOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.49-1.75; P<0.001) were all significantly higher for infants with mothers with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. When the analysis was restricted to pregnancies delivered at term (&#8805;37 weeks), there were no significant differences in neonatal adverse outcome (P=0.78), need for specialist neonatal care after birth (P=0.22) or neonatal readmission within four weeks of birth (P=0.05). Neonates born at term to mothers with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to have prolonged admission following birth (21.1% compared to 14.6%, aOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.49-1.75; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of birth is associated with higher rates of fetal death, preterm birth, preeclampsia and emergency Cesarean delivery. There were no additional adverse neonatal outcomes, other than those related to preterm delivery.

o4p756q8,,WHO,Spatial Heterogeneity Can Lead to Substantial Local Variations in COVID-19 Timing and Severity,,,,unk,"Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of compartment (SIR) models at local scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local mixing. Here, we examine the effect of employing more geographically detailed diffusion models based on known spatial features of interpersonal networks, most particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the probability of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 U.S cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate highly non-uniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform healthcare planning, predict community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.",2020,"Thomas, Loring Huang Peng Yin Fan Luo Xiaoshuang Iris Almquist Zack Hipp John Butts Carter",,,#ppcovidwho-322714,,,,,218718861.0

Methods: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented screen exposure and decline in daily structure in youth, making recognizing and treating problematic screen use essential to mental health care. Despite internet gaming disorder (IGD) in section 3 of the DSM-5 and gaming disorder in the ICD, there is a lack of standards for screening, assessment, and treatment of media-related problems in child and adolescent psychiatry. The audience will be polled to gauge current related practices. The author will share valuable techniques for assessing this topic and approaches to maintain neutrality and alliance with patients and their parents, while maximizing engagement. Psychotherapeutic treatment options will be explored, including CBT and motivational interviewing (MI), psychoeducation, psychodynamic approaches, and mindfulness. Effective treatment courses may include a “dopamine detoxification,” followed by a phase of external regulation with the eventual goal of self-regulation. Aspects of the author’s 12-year experience as an internet and video game addiction specialist will be incorporated, including cases highlighting clinical themes. Results: Problematic screen use frequently presents in clinical practice and is often obscured and complicated by a lack of insight. Such problems are easily missed by psychiatrists without careful inquiry. Patients often resist frank discussion of problematic habits and remain ambivalent toward addressing them. Many have evaded attempts by authority figures to restrict their use and are predisposed against similar attempts by providers. MI can help assess and address these challenges and encourage a healthy relationship with technology. Clinicians must effectively psychoeducate their patients and guide them through the stages of change and phases of treatment to achieve a healthy, self-regulated relationship with digital technology. Conclusions: The need for clinicians to screen for, assess, and treat problematic screen use continues to grow at an overwhelming pace. Psychiatrists meet this challenge by adapting and enhancing psychotherapeutic tools to assess and treat children and teens with problematic screen media use.

nl8lvzo7,,WHO,Laboratory preparedness for SARS-CoV-2 testing in India: Harnessing a network of Virus Research & Diagnostic Laboratories,,,,unk,"Background & objectives: An outbreak of respiratory illness of unknown aetiology was reported from Hubei province of Wuhan, People's Republic of China, in December 2019. The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. Results: Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice - at days 0 and 14. All tested negative on both occasions. Only three individuals belonging to different districts in Kerala were found to be positive. Interpretation & conclusions: Sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to cause a pandemic posed an unsurmountable challenge to the public health system of India. However, concerted efforts of various arms of the Government of India resulted in a well-coordinated action at each level. India has successfully demonstrated its ability to establish quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at NIV, Pune, and the testing VRDLs.",2020,"Gupta, Nivedita; Potdar, Varsha; Praharaj, Ira; Giri, Sidhartha; Sapkal, Gajanan; Yadav, Pragya; Choudhary, Manohar Lal; Dar, Lalit; Sugunan, A P; Kaur, Harmanmeet; Munivenkatappa, Ashok; Shastri, Jayanthi; Kaveri, Krishnasamy; Dutta, Shanta; Malhotra, Bharti; Jain, Amita; Nagamani, Kammilli; Shantala, G B; Raut, Sharmila; Vegad, M M; Sharma, Ajanta; Choudhary, Aashish; Brijwal, Megha; Balakrishnan, Anukumar; Manjunatha, Jayaswamy; Pathak, Manish; Srinivasan, Sivasubramanian; Banu, Hasina; Sharma, Himanshu; Jain, Parul; Sunita, Pakalpati; Ambica, R; Fageria, Babita; Patel, Disha; Rajbongshi, Gitika; Vijay, Neetu; Narayan, Jitendra; Aggarwal, Neeraj; Nagar, Anu; Gangakhedkar, Raman R; Abraham, Priya",Indian J Med Res,,#32576,,,,,214769456.0

But it is not clear whether endometriosis increases the risk of COVID–19. Methods: : Women who referred to the gynecology clinic were evaluated and 507 women with endometriosis (case group) were compared with 520 women without endometriosis (control group). COVID–19 infection, symptoms, exposure, hospitalization, isolation, H1N1 infection and vaccination, and past medical history of the participants were recorded and compared between the groups using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 21. Results: : Comparison between the groups represent COVID–19 infection in 3.2% of the case group and 3% of the control group (P=.942). The control group had a higher frequency of asymptomatic infection (95.7% vs. 94.5%;P<.001) and fever (1.6% vs. 0%;P=.004), while the frequency of rare symptoms was more common in the case group (P<.001). The average disease period was 14 days in both groups (P=.694).

METHODS In May 2020, attendees of the virtual Research in Education and Practice Symposium (REPS) were invited to participate in two 1-hour networking sessions. During these sessions, participants completed individual and group reflection exercises where they were asked questions about their experiences during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who volunteered submitted their responses through an electronic survey application. Anonymous responses were coded using thematic analysis to address the research questions. RESULTS Sixty-eight and 38 participants, respectively, attended the 2 networking discussions. Participant-identified professional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis included unexpected learning experiences, greater adaptability, workflow and learning interruptions, and decreased productivity. Personal impacts included a greater focus on well-being, physical and social isolation, and changes in travel plans. Participants noted positive and negative emotions including acceptance, encouragement, anxiety, stress, and frustration. The main lessons learned focused on adaptability, gratitude, and empathy. Participants shared that they wished they would have known the anticipated duration of the pandemic, associated workflow changes, and reliance on technology prior to the start of the pandemic. In addition, they predicted that pharmacy practice will require changes to workflow flexibility, training expectations, the pharmacist's role, and organizational structure. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has positively and negatively impacted the professional and personal lives of pharmacy learners and educators, with the most notable impacts being in the areas of well-being and adaptability. Future research should explore the experiences of other workforce personnel and evaluate the long-term impact on pharmacy practice, patient outcomes, and workforce well-being and resiliency.",2021-05-06,"Sasser, Caroline Welles; Wolcott, Michael D; Morbitzer, Kathryn A; Eckel, Stephen F",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954427/,233868938.0

OBJECTIVE: To objectively evaluate the effects of RPEincluding medical masks and respiratorson the skin barrier by measuring various physiological properties of the skin. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. Twenty healthy health care workerswere included in this study. Skin parameters including skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema, sebum secretion, pH, and skin temperature were measured in the RPE-covered and uncovered areas of the face 4 and 8 h after wearing RPE and 14 hafter not wearing RPE. RESULTS: Skin hydration, TEWL, erythema, pH, and skin temperature increased in the RPE-covered areasafter wearing RPE for 4 and 8h. On the other hand, in the RPE-uncovered areas, skin hydration decreased and TEWL, erythema, and pH showed minimal changes over time. Based on the repeated-measure analysis, the changes in skin physiological properties over time were significantly different between RPE-covered and RPE-uncovered areas. CONCLUSION: We observed that skin physiological characteristics change with the prolonged use ofRPEsuch as medical masks and respirators.These changes may lead to various adverse skin reactions after long term use.

They are in the school-age period and have received sufficient information about social distancing as prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission. AIM: This study aimed to explore the attitude and behavior related to social distancing in response to prevent COVID-19 transmission among adolescents living in the coastal area, Indonesia. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that invited adolescents in the coastal area, Madura, East Java, Indonesia, as participants. Data were collected conveniently through an online questionnaire. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed for the analysis of the data. RESULTS: A total of 224 participants completed the survey. A number of participants disagreed to certain attitudes related to social distancing including praying from home (21%), wearing a mask (15%), and not organizing mass gathering events (9%). Furthermore, as many as 44% of participants refused to facilitate infected people to do self-isolation. CONCLUSION: The attitudes related to the social distancing of adolescents living in the coastal area might be influenced by culture and Islam reference. Therefore, a religious approach is considered important to be involved in the preparation of strategic actions in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 through social distancing. The refusal of participants to isolate an infected person might be caused by a limited knowledge about COVID-19 prevention.

Identifying these could help formulate effective public health strategies. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 for each of the 220 countries as on July 30, 2020 were evaluated against key epidemiological variables, namely - BCG vaccination (ongoing vs. discontinued/never undertaken), %population aged [â¥]65 years, incidences of ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), cancer, malaria, and diabetes; human development index (HDI) and population density. These were retrieved from the public domains of WHO, UN, World Bank and published reports. The COVID-19 CFRs ranged between 0.0% and 28.3% (mean {+/-} SD: 3.05% {+/-} 3.48). The influence of the individual epidemiological parameters on CFR were evaluated through the event rate estimations. A significantly lower event rate was observed in countries with ongoing BCG vaccination program (ER: with vs without ongoing BCG vaccination: 0.020 vs 0.034, p<0.001). The type of BCG strains used also influenced the ER; this being 0.018, 0.031 and 0.019 for early, late and mixed strains respectively (p=0.008). The epidemiological variables significantly associated with higher COVID-19 event rate were countries with higher %population aged [â¥]65 years (p<0.001), greater incidence of IHD (p<0.001) and cancer (p=0.003) and better HDI (p=0.003). Incidences of malaria, HHD and diabetes along with population density had no significant impact on COVID-19 CFR. Further, BCG vaccination significantly lowered the COVID-19 ER in each of the high-risk population subgroups - countries with >7.1% population aged [â¥]65 years (p=0.008), >0.737 HDI (p=0.001), IHD >1171/105 population (p=0.004) and cancer incidence >15726 (p<0.001). The results supports BCG induced trained immunity leading to heterologous immunoprotection against COVID-19.

The vaccines and bio-therapeutic protein production in plants hold the promise of significantly lowering the cost of manufacturing life-saving drugs. This review will reflect the current status and challenges that the molecular farming platform faces becoming a strategic solution for the development of low-cost bio-therapeutics for developing countries. RECENT FINDINGS: Different plant parts have been successfully identified as suitable expression systems for the commercial production of therapeutic proteins for some human and animal diseases ranging from common cold to AIDS. The processed therapeutics from such sources are devoid of any toxic components. The large-scale cultivation of these transgenic plants would be possible anywhere in the world including developing countries, which lack sophisticated drug manufacturing units. A couple of such commercially generated products have already hit the market with success. Newer methods using suitable plant viruses and recombinant gene expression systems have already been devised for producing therapeutic proteins and peptides. SUMMARY: Plants are promising bio-factories for therapeutic protein production because of their several advantages over the other expression systems especially the advanced mechanisms for protein synthesis and post-translational modification which are very much similar to animal cells. Plant biotechnologists are much attracted to the bio-farming because of its flexibility, scalability, low manufacturing cost, as well as the lack of risk of toxic or pathogenic contamination. A number of projects on bio-farming are designed and are at various developmental stages but have not yet become available to the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we need further advancement in the optimization of lab protocols for up-scaling the production of such therapeutics at commercial level with a promise to offer their best clinical use.",2017-10-16,"Singh, Ankit; Kaur, Gurminder; Singh, Sanchita; Singh, Neetu; Saxena, Gauri; Verma, Praveen C.",Curr Mol Biol Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a18c85c2b16eab20779da0d0d870f94e5b94b23c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099902.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40610-017-0078-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226727/,29871600.0

The number of infections increases daily, without any approved antiviral therapy. The recently released viral nucleotide sequence enables the identification of therapeutic targets, e.g. by analyzing integrated human-virus metabolic models. Investigations of changed metabolic processes after virus infections and the effect of knock-outs on the host and the virus can reveal new potential targets. RESULTS: We generated an integrated host–virus genome-scale metabolic model of human alveolar macrophages and SARS-CoV-2. Analyses of stoichiometric and metabolic changes between uninfected and infected host cells using flux balance analysis (FBA) highlighted the different requirements of host and virus. Consequently, alterations in the metabolism can have different effects on host and virus, leading to potential antiviral targets. One of these potential targets is guanylate kinase (GK1). In FBA analyses, the knock-out of the GK1 decreased the growth of the virus to zero, while not affecting the host. As GK1 inhibitors are described in the literature, its potential therapeutic effect for SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to be verified in in-vitro experiments.

We assessed vaccine-induced antibody response to the SARS-CoV2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant in 57 patients with B cell malignancies with and without active B cell-targeted therapy. Ancestral- and Omicron- reactive antibody levels were determined by ELISA and neutralization assays. In over one third of vaccinated patients at the pre-booster timepoint, there were no ELISA-detectable antibodies against either the ancestral strain or Omicron variant. The lack of vaccine-induced antibodies was predominantly in patients receiving active therapy such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi). While booster immunization was able to induce detectable antibodies in a small fraction of seronegative patients, the benefit was disproportionately evident in patients not on active therapy. Importantly, in patients with post-booster ELISA-detectable antibodies, there was a positive correlation of antibody levels against the ancestral strain and Omicron variant. Booster immunization increased overall antibody levels, including neutralizing antibody titers against the ancestral strain and Omicron variant; however, predominantly in patients without active therapy. Furthermore, ancestral strain neutralizing antibody titers were about 5-fold higher in comparison with those to Omicron, suggesting that even with booster administration, there may be reduced protection against the Omicron variant. Interestingly, in almost all patients regardless of active therapy, including those unable to generate detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV2 spike, we observed comparable levels of EBV, influenza, and common cold coronavirus reactive antibodies demonstrating that B cell-targeting therapies primarily impair de novo but not pre-existing antibody levels. These findings suggest that patients with B cell malignancies on active therapy may be at disproportionately higher risk to new versus endemic viral infection and suggest utility for vaccination prior to B cell-targeted therapy.",2022-03-18,"Azar, J.; Evans, J.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between receipt of unemployment insurance, including a $600/wk federal supplement between April and July, and food insecurity among people who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used difference-in-differences analysis of longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of US adults residing in low- and middle-income households (ie, <$75 000 annual income) who lost work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were from 15 waves of the Understanding Coronavirus in America study (conducted April 1 to November 11, 2020). EXPOSURE: Receipt of unemployment insurance benefits. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Food insecurity and eating less due to financial constraints, assessed every 2 weeks by self-report. RESULTS: Of 2319 adults living in households earning less than $75 000 annually and employed in February 2020, 1119 (48.3%) experienced unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic and made up our main sample (588 [53.6%] White individuals; mean [SD] age 45 [15] years; 732 [65.4%] women).

OBJECTIVES: We explored the students' learning experiences of our telehealth clinical practice program by qualitatively analyzing student reports. METHODS: The participants were fourth-year undergraduate students who had taken the telehealth clinical practice program at Hiroshima University. Data were collected as reports from the participants during clinical practice and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Of the 59 students who completed the practical training, 26 agreed to participate in the study (consent rate: 44.1%). Sixteen themes emerged from the analysis as the students' learning experiences, and were classified into four thematic categories: (1) recognition of continued self-improvement required to become a nurse and development of a sense of ethics, (2) improvement of knowledge and practical skills in chronic care nursing, (3) acquisition of telehealth skills, and (4) learning through modeling and teamwork, and improvement of self-efficacy. Interacting with persons through telehealth provided an opportunity to learn directly about persons' lives and their experiences of illness, and helped participants develop a sense of responsibility and ethical nursing. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings indicate that undergraduate nursing students perceived that their attitude, knowledge and skill acquisition improved through this program.

Swabs were taken post-mortem during autopsy (N = 19) from the throat, both lungs, intestine, gallbladder, and brain or without autopsy (N = 9) only from the throat. Selective amplification of target nucleic acid from the samples was achieved by using primers for ORF1a/b non-structural region and the structural protein envelope E-gene of the virus. The results of 125 post-mortem and 47 ante-mortem swabs were presented as cycle threshold (Ct) values and categorized as strong, moderate, and weak. Viral RNA was detected more frequently in the lungs and throat than in the intestine. Blood, bile, and the brain were negative. Consecutive throat swabs were positive up to 128 h after death without significant increase of Ct values. All lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage, thrombosis, and infarction and less frequently bronchopneumonia irrespective of Ct values. In 30% the intestine revealed focal ischemic changes. Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 was detected by immunohistochemistry in bronchial and intestinal epithelium, bronchial glands, and pneumocytes.

Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)–OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.

Data were collected from 39 students who did not undertake prior preparation for engaging in distance education. Social presence, learning outcomes and satisfaction towards the course were measured by previous well-established scales, respectively. The students’ learning outcomes were evaluated through their code development. At the end of the course, the students filled out an online questionnaire which measured these three variables. The results of this study showed that all three variables were evaluated as satisfactory by the students. The results also indicated that social presence and code development were positively associated with satisfaction. Moreover, the results of the regression analysis indicated that social presence and code development were critical factors affecting students’ satisfaction. Together, these two factors explain 39.9% of the variance of satisfaction. Social presence alone contributed about 32.3% of this variance, suggesting that it may be very important in predicting satisfaction.

We took a Brazilian undergraduate course in the distance learning modality as a case study. We run seven classification models on normalized datasets, which comprised grades for three weeks of classes for a total of six weeks. Since it is an imbalanced-data context, adopting a single metric to identify the best predictive model of student failure would not be efficient. Therefore, the proposed framework considers 11 metrics generated by the classifiers run and the application of exclusion and ordering criteria to produce a list of best predictors.

The impact of public health measures practised by children during COVID-19 is relatively unknown. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the association between physical and social distancing measures and children’s outdoor time, sleep duration, and screen time during COVID-19. DESIGN/METHODS: A longitudinal study using repeated measures of exposures and outcomes was conducted in healthy children (0 to 10 years) between April 14 and July 15, 2020. Parents were asked to complete questionnaires about isolation, physical distancing practices, and children’s health behaviours. The primary exposure was the average number of days that children practised physical and social distancing measures per week. The three outcomes were children’s outdoor time, total screen time, and sleep duration during COVID-19. Linear mixed effects models were fitted using repeated measures of primary exposure and outcomes. RESULTS: This study included 554 observations from 265 children. Physical and social distancing measures were associated with shorter outdoor time (-17.2; 95% CI -22.07, -12.40; p < 0.001) and longer total screen time (11.3; 95% CI 3.88, 18.79; p = 0.003) during COVID-19. The association with outdoor time was stronger in younger children (< 5 years), and the associations with total screen time were stronger in females and in older children (≥ 5 years). CONCLUSION: Physical and social distancing measures during COVID-19 have resulted in negative impacts on the health behaviours of Canadian children living in a large metropolitan area.

How the behavior of intact proteins in the gas phase depends on the presence and distribution of ionizable surface residues has been difficult to answer because multiple chargeable sites are present in virtually all proteins. Turning to protein engineering, we show that ionizable side chains are completely dispensable for charging under native conditions, but if present, they are preferential protonation sites. The absence of ionizable side chains results in identical charge state distributions under native-like and denaturing conditions, while coexisting conformers can be distinguished using ion mobility separation. An excess of ionizable side chains, on the other hand, effectively modulates protein ion stability. In fact, moving a single ionizable group can dramatically alter the gas-phase conformation of a protein ion. We conclude that although the sum of the charges is governed solely by Coulombic terms, their locations affect the stability of the protein in the gas phase.",2021-11-29,"Abramsson, Mia L.; Sahin, Cagla; Hopper, Jonathan T.

Remdesivir has been authorized for the treatment of COVID-19. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the incidence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence of AKI in different subgroups was also investigated. METHODS: A thorough search was performed to find relevant studies in PubMed, Web of Science, medRxiv and EMBASE from 1 Jan 2020 until 1 June 2020. The systematic review was performed using the meta package in R (4.0.1). RESULTS: A total of 16,199 COVID-19 patients were included in our systematic review. The pooled estimated incidence of AKI in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 10.0% (95% CI: 7.0-12.0%). The pooled estimated proportion of COVID-19 patients who needed continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was 4% (95% CI: 3-6%). According to our subgroup analysis, the incidence of AKI could be associated with age, disease severity and ethnicity. The incidence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients being treated with remdesivir was 7% (95% CI: 3-13%) in a total of 5 studies. CONCLUSION: We found that AKI was not rare in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence of AKI could be associated with age, disease severity and ethnicity. Remdesivir probably did not induce AKI in COVID-19 patients. Our systematic review provides evidence that AKI might be closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should be investigated in future studies.",2021,"Xu, Zhenjian; Tang, Ying; Huang, Qiuyan; Fu, Sha; Li, Xiaomei; Lin, Baojuan; Xu, Anping; Chen, Junzhe",BMC Nephrol,,#1067203,,,,,231811712.0

In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate COVID-19 vaccination coverage among healthcare workers (HCWs) in obstetrics and gynecology, during the first three-month period of the vaccination campaign after COVID-19 vaccines were approved. A total of 662 eligible HCWs, consisting of 250 HCWs (group one) who participated in a Jiangsu provincial symposium and 412 HCWs (group two) in the department of obstetrics and gynecology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, were invited to answer a 23-question questionnaire. In total, 618 (93.4%) HCWs completed the questionnaire. The vaccine acceptance in group one was higher than that in group two (87.2% [197/226] vs 74.2% [291/392], χ2 = 14.436, P < .001). Overall, 488 (79.0%) HCWs received COVID-19 vaccination and 130 (21.0%) declined vaccination. One-third of the 488 vaccinees were not vaccinated until consulted with others or requested by employers.

There is a desire to cough and the patient expectorates nothing worth mentioning.” He also described an open drainage procedure: “When the fifteenth day after rupture has appeared, prepare a warm bath, set him upon a stool, which is not wobbly, someone should hold his hands, then shake him by the shoulders and listen to see on which side a noise is heard. And right at this place, preferably on the left, make an incision, then it produces death more rarely.”1,2 Beyond providing less-wobbly stools, few advances were made for more than 2000 years that allowed surgeons to routinely enter the pleural cavity, the fear being a potentially fatal pneumothorax.

Present study highlights the deterrents to recruiting CCP donors at a hospital based blood centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potential CCP donors were contacted individually by telephone and a group approach through camp organisers from May to July 2020. Recruitment challenges were noted and deferrals of these recruited donors during screening and medical examination was obtained and analysed. RESULTS: Total 1165 potential CCP donors were contacted. Around 47% donors were lost due to challenges related to information storage and retrieval. Fear of health, family pressure, and fear of a new procedure were major reason (27.2%) for unwillingness to donate. The main reasons for deferral among potential donors were multiparity (38%) and being overage/underage (31.6%). Finally, 468 donors were recruited including 408 by individual approach and 60 by a group approach. From these absence of detectable COVID-19 antibodies were found in 15.4%. Few donors (9.0%) were deferred as they had not completed 28 days post recovery. CONCLUSION: The process of CCP donor recruitment differs from that of whole blood donation and requires an individualised approach with involvement of clinicians in the initial phases of the pandemic. A group approach targeting specific organisations could be adopted for a successful CCP collection program. There is a need to relook into some aspects of donor selection such as consideration of multiparous female donors and overage/underage donors after reviewing scientific evidence.",2021,"Dhiman, Yashaswi; Coshic, Poonam; Pandey, Hem Chandra; Khatiwada, Basanta; Singh, Jasmeet; Mehta, Vikas; Gupta, Sanjay",Transfus. med,,#1142976,,,,,232309983.0

Having little access to their social networks and support systems, people have had to turn to digital tools and spaces to cope with their experiences of anxiety and loss. With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, many of us are likely to remain reliant upon DMH for the foreseeable future. As such, it is important to articulate some of the specific ways in which the pandemic is affecting our self and world-relation, such that we can identify how DMH services are best able to accommodate some of the newly emerging needs of their users. In this paper I will identify a specific type of loss brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and present it as an important concept for DMH. I refer to this loss as loss of perceptual world-familiarity. Loss of perceptual world-familiarity entails a breakdown in the ongoing effortless responsiveness to our perceptual environment that characterizes much of our everyday lives. To cash this out I will turn to insights from the phenomenological tradition. Initially, my project is descriptive. I aim to bring out how loss of perceptual world-familiarity is a distinctive form of loss that is deeply pervasive yet easily overlooked—hence the relevance of explicating it for DMH purposes. But I will also venture into the space of the normative, offering some reasons for seeing perceptual world-familiarity as a component of well-being. I conclude the paper with a discussion of how loss of perceptual world-familiarity affects the therapeutic setting now that most if not all therapeutic interactions have transitioned to online spaces and I explore the potential to augment these spaces with social interaction technologies. Throughout, my discussion aims to do justice to the reality that perceptual world-familiarity is not an evenly distributed phenomenon, that factors like disability, gender and race affect its robustness, and that this ought to be reckoned with when seeking to incorporate the phenomenon into or mitigate it through DMH services.",2020-09-01,"van Grunsven, Janna",Ethics Inf Technol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ea8c22be26cfa22a1f35edbc7fa1667039d5169a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7462105.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32905100/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-020-09554-y,221459880.0

Traditional vaccines against animal viral diseases are based on inactivated or attenuated viruses, but new subunit vaccines are gaining attention from researchers in animal vaccinology. Among these, virus-like particles (VLPs) represent one of the most appealing approaches opening up interesting frontiers in animal vaccines. VLPs are robust protein scaffolds exhibiting well-defined geometry and uniformity that mimic the overall structure of the native virions but lack the viral genome. They are often antigenically indistinguishable from the virus from which they were derived and present important advantages in terms of safety. VLPs can stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune responses and have been shown to exhibit self-adjuvanting abilities. In addition to their suitability as a vaccine for the homologous virus from which they are derived, VLPs can also be used as vectors for the multimeric presentation of foreign antigens. VLPs have therefore shown dramatic effectiveness as candidate vaccines; nevertheless, only one veterinary VLP-base vaccine is licensed.

L’infection à SARS-Co-2 s’est répandue dans le monde entier et des taux de mortalité plus élevés ont été signalés chez les personnes âgées et les patients atteints de comorbidités. Le but principal de cette étude était de définir l’incidence et le pronostic de la COVID-19 chez les patients atteints de DBAI. Matériel et méthodes Quatre-vingt-quinze patients atteints de DBAI suivis dans le département de dermatologie et de vénéréologie de Casablanca, entre janvier 2015 et janvier 2021 ont été inclus. Le diagnostic de la COVID-19 a été basé sur une PCR positive ou une atteinte pulmonaire typique à la tomodensitométrie thoracique. Résultats Parmi les quatre-vingt-quinze patients, seize (16,8 %) ont eu un diagnostic de COVID-19, neuf ont été hospitalisés, dont cinq en unité de soins intensifs, etquatre sont décédés. Le SARS-Cov-2 a été détecté chez 14 patients (87,5 %) par la PCR. Dix patients (62, 5 %) ont réalisé une tomodensitométrie. Neuf patients étaient suivis pour un pemphigus et sept pour une pemphigoïde bulleuse. Quatre patients (25 %) recevaient de la prednisone>10mg/jour, dont trois (75 %) présentaient des symptômes graves. Cinq (31, 2 %) étaient sous≤10mg/jour, et sept (43, 7 %) n’étaient pas sous corticothérapie, dont quatre (33 %) présentaient des symptômes graves. La plupart des patients atteints de pemphigoïde bulleuse avaient des symptômes graves et ont été hospitalisés. Aucun des patients n’avait interrompu les traitements prescrits ; aucun des trois patients sous rituximab n’avait présenté des symptômes liés à la COVID-19. L’étude analytique a révélé un risque relatif (RR) d’avoir une forme grave de COVID-19 de 4, 71 pour les patients présentant des comorbidités et un RR de 2, 27 pour les patients recevant plus de 10mg/jour de prednisone. Discussion Bien que l’âge avancé et d’autres comorbidités telles que l’hypertension artérielle et le diabète soient des facteurs de risque bien définis des formes graves de COVID-19, le rôle de l’immunosuppression est toujours controversé. La plupart des patients atteints de pemphigoïde bulleuse ont eu des symptômes graves et ont été hospitalisés, ce qui peut être lié au fait que cette maladie survient chez des patients âgés qui présentent généralement d’autres comorbidités. Une dose de prednisone≥10mg/jour a été associée à un risque accru d’hospitalisation.

Topical therapy is the gold standard for psoriasis patients with mild disease courses and for complementary and maintenance treatment in moderate and severe forms. However, while new systemic therapies are rapidly implemented in the daily routine as our pathomechanistic understanding of psoriasis evolves, the development of topical psoriasis therapies stagnates. Modern topical treatments though would require not only new active substances but also improved galenics. Due to their unique ability to directly exert biologic functions, but also to deliver drugs in optimal concentrations, enabling increased therapeutic efficacy, reduced adverse effects and improved patient compliance, nanoparticles may represent ideal drug carriers for local therapeutics in psoriasis. In recent years, a series of reports added important insights into the biology of skin-nanoparticles interactions and on how they impact the epidermal and dermal inflammatory compartments in vitro and in psoriasis plaques. Furthermore, by targeting anti-inflammatory substances to specific skin compartments, nanotechnological advances offer the exciting opportunity to fine tune skin inflammation at molecular and cellular levels, paving the road to a high-precision, skin-directed topical therapy in psoriasis. However, nanoparticles-based therapies have not yet found their way into clinical routine in dermatology.

To quantify and describe the impact of a number of prognostic factors, including frailty and inflammatory markers. SETTING: Five acute National Health Service Hospitals in east London. DESIGN: Prospectively defined observational study using registry data. PARTICIPANTS: 1737 patients aged 16 years or over admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 January and 13 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of first hospital admission with COVID-19 diagnosis during or prior to admission. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU and hospital length of stay and type and duration of organ support. Multivariable survival analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared with white patients, those from minority ethnic backgrounds were younger, with differing comorbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, (95% CI 1.06 to 2.23); p=0.023 and OR 1.80 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.71); p=0.005, respectively).

These findings persisted across a range of risk factor-adjusted analyses accounting for major comorbidities, obesity, smoking, frailty and ABO blood group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds had higher mortality from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders and frailty.

Azithromycin, in association with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, has been proposed as one such medication. The aim of this review is to describe the pharmacological mechanism, clinical evidence and prescribing guidelines concerning azithromycin in COVID-19 patients. There is weak evidence on the antiviral and immunomodulating effects of azithromycin, which in addition is not based on results from COVID-19 patients specifically. Therefore, this antibacterial should be considered only as empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), although not all current treatment guidelines are in agreement. After the initial expectations raised by a small trial, more recent evidence has raised serious safety concerns on the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with azithromycin to treat COVID-19 patients, as all these drugs have arrhythmogenic potential. The World Health Organization has not made recommendations suggesting the use of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as treatment for COVID-19, but some national organisations have taken a different position, recommending this as first-line treatment.

In both relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), patients may experience variable disability accrual and symptoms throughout their disease course. The potential impact on the quality of life (QoL) in pwMS and their families and carers is profound. The introduction of treatment targets, such as NEDA (no evidence of disease activity) and NEPAD (no evidence of progression or active disease), that guide clinical decision-making, highlight the importance of utilizing sensitive instruments to measure and track disease activity and progression. However, the gold standard neurological disability tool—expanded disability severity scale (EDSS)—has universally recognized limitations. With strides made in our understanding of MS pathophysiology and DMT responsiveness, maintaining the status quo of measuring disability progression is no longer the recommended option. Outside the clinical trial setting, a comprehensive monitoring system has not been robustly established for pwMS. A 21st-century approach is required to integrate clinical, paraclinical, and patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from electronic health records, local databases, and patient registries.

When IC is not available, predicted resting energy expenditure (pREE) equations are commonly utilized, which often inaccurately predict metabolic demands leading to over- or under-feeding. This study aims to longitudinally assess mREE via IC in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection throughout the entirety of, often prolonged, intensive care unit (ICU) stays and compare mREE to commonly utilized pREE equations. Methods This single-center prospective cohort study of 38 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients from April 1, 2020 to February 1, 2021. The Q-NRG® Metabolic Monitor was used to obtain IC data. The Harris-Benedict (HB), Mifflin St-Jeor (MSJ), Penn State University (PSU), and weight-based equations from the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition – Society of Critical Care Medicine (ASPEN-SCCM) Clinical Guidelines were utilized to assess the accuracy of common pREE equations and their ability to predict hypo/hypermetabolism in COVID-19 ICU patients. Results The IC measures collected revealed a relatively normometabolic or minimally hypermetabolic mREE at 21.3 kcal/kg/d or 110% of predicted by the HB equation over the first week of mechanical ventilation (MV). This progressed to significant and uniquely prolonged hypermetabolism over successive weeks to 28.1 kcal/kg/d or 143% of HB predicted by MV week 3, with hypermetabolism persisting to MV week 7. Obese individuals displayed a more truncated response with significantly lower mREE versus non-obese patients in MV week 1 (19.5±1.0 kcal/kg/d vs 25.1±1.8 kcal/kg/d, respectively; p < 0.01), with little change in weeks 2-3 (19.5±1.5 kcal/kg/d vs 28.0±2.0 kcal/kg/d; p < 0.01). Both ASPEN-SCCM upper range and PSU pREE equations provided close approximations of mREE yet, like all pREE equations, occasionally over- and under-predicted energy needs and typically did not predict late hypermetabolism. Conclusions Study results show a truly unique metabolic response in COVID-19 ICU patients, characterized by significant and prolonged, progressive hypermetabolism peaking at 3 weeks’ post-intubation, persisting for up to 7 weeks in ICU. This pattern was more clearly demonstrated in non-obese versus obese patients. This response is unique and distinct from any previously described model of ICU stress response in its prolonged hypermetabolic nature. This data reaffirms the need for routine, longitudinal IC measures to provide accurate energy targets in COVID-19 ICU patients. The PSU and ASPEN-SCCM equations appear to yield the most reasonable estimation to IC-derived mREE in COVID-19 ICU patients, yet still often over-/under-predict energy needs.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the number of Red Knots found at Delaware Bay dramatically declined from ~50,000 to ~13,000. Horseshoe crabs have been harvested for use as bait in eel and whelk fisheries since at least 1990, and some avian conservation biologists hypothesized that harvest levels in the 1990s prevented sufficient refueling for successful migration to the breeding grounds, nesting, and survival for the remainder of the annual cycle. Since 2013, the harvest of horseshoe crabs in the Delaware Bay region has been managed using an Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) framework. The objective of the ARM framework is to manage sustainable harvest of Delaware Bay horseshoe crabs while maintaining ecosystem integrity and supporting Red Knot recovery with adequate stopover habitat for Red Knots and other migrating shorebirds. For annual harvest recommendations, the ARM framework requires annual estimates of horseshoe crab population size and the Red Knot stopover population. We conducted a mark-recapture-resight investigation to estimate the passage population of Red Knots at Delaware Bay in 2021. We used a Bayesian analysis of a Jolly-Seber model, which accounts for turnover in the population and the probability of detection during surveys. The 2021 Red Knot mark-resight dataset included a total of 1,591 individual birds that were recorded at least one during mark-resight surveys at Delaware Bay in 2021. The passage population size in 2021 was estimated at 42,271 (95% credible interval: 35,948 – 55,210). Like 2020, the 2021 population estimate is slightly lower than the 2018 and 2019 estimates.

There are no known treatment regimens with proven efficacy and vaccines thus far, posing an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs and vaccines for prevention and treatment. The urgency for its prevention and cure has resulted in an increased number of proposed treatment options. The high rate and volume of emerging clinical trials on therapies for COVID-19 need to be compared and evaluated to provide scientific evidence for effective medical options. Other emerging non-conventional drug discovery techniques such as bioinformatics and cheminformatics, structure-based drug design, network-based methods for prediction of drug-target interactions, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and phage technique could provide alternative routes to discovering potent Anti-SARS-CoV2 drugs. While drugs are being repurposed and discovered for COVID-19, novel drug delivery systems will be paramount for efficient delivery and avoidance of possible drug resistance. This review describes the proposed drug targets for therapy, and outcomes of clinical trials that have been reported.

Nowadays, the WHO recognizes traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine for treating COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, we investigated the antiviral potential of the hydroalcoholic extract of Uncaria tomentosa stem bark from Peru against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The antiviral activity of U. tomentosa against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro was assessed in Vero E6 cells using cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. After 48 h of treatment, U. tomentosa showed an inhibition of 92.7% of SARS-CoV-2 at 25.0 μg/mL (p < 0.0001) by plaque reduction assay on Vero E6 cells. In addition, U. tomentosa induced a reduction of 98.6% (p=0.02) and 92.7% (p=0.03) in the CPE caused by SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells at 25 μg/mL and 12.5 μg/mL, respectively. The EC50 calculated for the U. tomentosa extract by plaque reduction assay was 6.6 μg/mL (4.89–8.85 μg/mL) for a selectivity index of 4.1. The EC50 calculated for the U. tomentosa extract by TCID50 assay was 2.57 μg/mL (1.05–3.75 μg/mL) for a selectivity index of 10.54. These results showed that U. tomentosa, known as cat's claw, has an antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2, which was observed as a reduction in the viral titer and CPE after 48 h of treatment on Vero E6 cells.

Since July 2014, an unexpected large dengue outbreak has occurred in Guangdong province, China, resulting in more than 40000 patients including six deaths. To clarify and characterize the causative agent of this outbreak, the acute phase serum from a patient diagnosed with severe dengue was subjected to virus isolation and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Traditional real-time RT-PCR and HTS with Ion Torrent PGM detected the presence of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). A clinical DENV-2 isolate GZ05/2014 was obtained by culturing the patient serum in mosquito C6/36 cells. The complete genome of GZ05/2014 was determined and deposited in GenBank under the access number KP012546. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete envelope gene showed that the newly DENV-2 isolate belonged to Cosmopolitan genotype and clustered closely with other Guangdong strains isolated in the past decade. No amino acid mutations that are obviously known to increase virulence or replication were identified throughout the genome of GZ05/2014. The high homology of Guangdong DENV-2 strains indicated the possibility of establishment of local DENV-2 circulation in Guangdong, China. These results help clarify the origin of this epidemic and predict the future status of dengue in China.

We investigated the impact of letermovir prophylaxis on mortality through Week 48 post-HCT. METHODS: Adult CMV-seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA at screening who could initiate treatment by Week 4 post-HCT were eligible. Subjects stratified by high or low CMV disease risk were randomized 2:1 to letermovir dosed at 480 mg/d (240 mg/d if on cyclosporine) or placebo PO or IV through Week 14 post-HCT. Time to all-cause mortality and non-relapse mortality (defined as death due to any reason other than the indication for HCT) through Week 48 post-HCT are presented using Kaplan–Meier (KM) plots censored at study discontinuation for reasons other than death/non-relapse death or upon study completion. Distribution of time to mortality endpoints was tested by stratified log-rank tests using two-sided P-values. RESULTS: This analysis included all 565 patients randomized and treated with ≥1 dose of study drug. Subjects began study drug a median of 9 days post-HCT; 36.5% started post-engraftment. The observed KM event rate for all-cause mortality was lower in the letermovir group (10.6%) than the placebo group (15.5%) at Week 24 post-HCT, and remained lower through Week 48 post-HCT (21.4% vs. 26.2%) (Figure 1). The observed K–M event rate for all-cause mortality in subjects who developed CS-CMVi was also lower in the letermovir group (4.6%) than the placebo group (17.1%) at Week 48 post-HCT. The observed KM event rate for non-relapse mortality was lower in the letermovir group (6.9%) vs. the placebo group (11.2%) at Week 24 post-HCT, and remained lower in the letermovir group (13.9%) than the placebo group (17.5%) through Week 48 post-HCT (Figure 2). CONCLUSION: All-cause and non-relapse mortality were reduced in the letermovir group compared with the placebo group through Week 48 post-HCT (relative risk reduction ~18% and ~21%, respectively). These results are consistent with a clinically meaningful survival benefit for letermovir prophylaxis. DISCLOSURES: J.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) necessitating continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a severe complication in trauma patients (TP). We wanted to assess daily duration of CRRT and its impact on uremic control in TP. Material and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed adult TP, with or without rhabdomyolysis, with AKI undergoing CRRT. Data on daily CRRT duration and causes for temporary stops were collected from the first five CRRT days. Uremic control was assessed by daily changes in serum urea (Δurea) and creatinine (Δcreatinine) concentrations. Results. Thirty-six TP were included with a total of 150 CRRT days, 17 (43%) with rhabdomyolysis. The median (interquartile range (IQR)) time per day with CRRT was 19 (15-21) hours. There was a significant correlation between daily CRRT duration and Δurea (r = 0.60, P≤0.001) and Δcreatinine (r = 0.43; P = 0.012).

6ntfhs7a,,WHO,Mechanisms and evidence of vertical transmission of infections in pregnancy including SARS-CoV-2s,,,,unk,"There remain unanswered questions concerning mother-to-child-transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Despite reports of neonatal COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has not been consistently isolated in perinatal samples, thus definitive proof of transplacental infection is still lacking. To address these questions, we assessed investigative tools used to confirm maternal-fetal infection and known protective mechanisms of the placental barrier that prevent transplacental pathogen migration. Forty studies of COVID-19 pregnancies reviewed suggest a lack of consensus on diagnostic strategy for congenital infection. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction of neonatal swabs was universally performed, a wide range of clinical samples was screened including vaginal secretions (22.5%), amniotic fluid (35%), breast milk (22.5%) and umbilical cord blood. Neonatal COVID-19 was reported in eight studies, two of which were based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in neonatal blood. Histological examination demonstrated sparse viral particles, vascular malperfusion and inflammation in the placenta from pregnant women with COVID-19. The paucity of placental co-expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors involved in cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2, may explain its relative insensitivity to transplacental infection. Viral interactions may utilise membrane receptors other than ACE-2 thus, tissue susceptibility may be broader than currently known.

In this study, we analyzed three new norovirus-specific Nanobodies that interacted with the prototype human norovirus (i.e., genogroup I genotype 1 [GI.1]). We showed that the Nanobodies bound on the side (Nano-7 and Nano-62) and top (Nano-94) of the capsid-protruding (P) domain using X-ray crystallography. Nano-7 and Nano-62 bound at a similar region on the P domain, but the orientations of these two Nanobodies clashed with the shell (S) domain and neighboring P domains on intact particles. This finding suggested that the P domains on the particles should shift in order for Nano-7 and Nano-62 to bind to intact particles. Interestingly, both Nano-7 and Nano-94 were capable of blocking norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) from binding to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), which are important cofactors for norovirus infection. Previously, we showed that the GI.1 HBGA pocket could be blocked with the soluble human milk oligosaccharide 2-fucosyllactose (2′FL). In the current study, we showed that a combined treatment of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2′FL enhanced the blocking potential with an additive (Nano-7) or synergistic (Nano-94) effect. We also found that GII Nanobodies with 2′FL also enhanced inhibition. The Nanobody inhibition likely occurred by different mechanisms, including particle aggregation or particle disassembly, whereas 2′FL blocked the HBGA binding site. Overall, these new data showed that the positive effect of the addition of 2′FL was not limited to a single mode of action of Nanobodies or to a single norovirus genogroup. IMPORTANCE The discovery of vulnerable regions on norovirus particles is instrumental in the development of effective inhibitors, particularly for GI noroviruses that are genetically diverse. Analysis of these GI.1-specific Nanobodies has shown that similar to GII norovirus particles, the GI particles have vulnerable regions. The only known cofactor region, the HBGA binding pocket, represents the main target for inhibition. With a combination treatment, i.e., the addition of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2′FL, the effect of inhibition was increased. Therefore, combination drug treatments might offer a better approach to combat norovirus infections, especially since the GI genotypes are highly diverse and are continually changing the capsid landscape, and few conserved epitopes have so far been identified.",2019-03-05,"Ruoff, Kerstin; Kilic, Turgay; Devant, Jessica; Koromyslova, Anna; Ringel, Alessa; Hempelmann, Alexander; Geiss, Celina; Graf, Juliane; Haas, Michelle; Roggenbach, Imme; Hansman, Grant",J Virol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/103497533321c2f879138d46b60ae87cd2fb74cc.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6401464.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30602609/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02005-18,58651445.0

They are produced by transfer of the glycan precursor to the sequon Asn-X-Thr/Ser, followed by enzymatic trimming to a high-mannose-type core and sequential addition of monosaccharides to generate complex-type and hybrid glycans. This process, mediated by the concerted action of multiple enzymes, produces a mixture of related glycoforms at each glycosite, making analysis of glycosylation difficult. To address this analytical challenge, we developed a robust semiquantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based method that determines the degree of glycan occupancy at each glycosite and the proportion of N-glycans processed from high-mannose type to complex type. It is applicable to virtually any glycoprotein, and a complete analysis can be conducted with 30 μg of protein. Here, we provide a detailed description of the method that includes procedures for (i) proteolytic digestion of glycoprotein(s) with specific and nonspecific proteases; (ii) denaturation of proteases by heating; (iii) sequential treatment of the glycopeptide mixture with two endoglycosidases, Endo H and PNGase F, to create unique mass signatures for the three glycosylation states; (iv) LC-MS/MS analysis; and (v) data analysis for identification and quantitation of peptides for the three glycosylation states. Full coverage of site-specific glycosylation of glycoproteins is achieved, with up to thousands of high-confidence spectra hits for each glycosite. The protocol can be performed by an experienced technician or student/postdoc with basic skills for proteomics experiments and takes ∼7 d to complete.

m64l0caz,,WHO,Assessing the Impact of a Rapidly Scaled Virtual Urgent Care in New York City During the COVID-19 Pandemic,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic quickly challenged New York City health care systems. Telemedicine has been suggested to manage acute complaints and divert patients from in-person care. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe and assess the impact of a rapidly scaled virtual urgent care platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who presented to a virtual urgent care platform over 1 month during the COVID-19 pandemic surge. We described scaling our telemedicine urgent care capacity, described patient clinical characteristics, assessed for emergency department (ED) referrals, and analyzed postvisit surveys. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 17,730 patients were seen via virtual urgent care; 454 (2.56%) were referred to an ED. The most frequent diagnoses were COVID-19 related or upper respiratory symptoms. Geospatial analysis indicated a wide catchment area. There were 251 providers onboarded to the platform; at peak, 62 providers supplied 364 h of coverage in 1 day. The average patient satisfaction score was 4.4/5. There were 2668 patients (15.05%) who responded to the postvisit survey; 1236 (49.35%) would have sought care in an ED (11.86%) or in-person urgent care (37.49%). CONCLUSIONS: A virtual urgent care platform was scaled to manage a volume of more than 800 patients a day across a large catchment area during the pandemic surge.

It is unknown whether treatment delays for patients eligible for curative chemoradiation (CRT) compromise long-term outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the National Cancer Data Base to investigate whether there is an association between a &#8805; 90-day delay from transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) in initiating CRT and overall survival. We included patients with cT2-4N0M0 muscle-invasive bladder cancer from 2004 to 2015 who underwent TURBT and curative-intent concurrent CRT. Patients were grouped on the basis of timing of CRT: &#8804; 89 days after TURBT (earlier) vs. &#8805; 90 and < 180 days after TURBT (delayed). RESULTS: A total of 1387 (87.5%) received earlier CRT (median, 45 days after TURBT; interquartile range, 34-59 days), and 197 (12.5%) received delayed CRT (median, 111 days after TURBT; interquartile range, 98-130 days). Median overall survival was 29.0 months (95% CI, 26.0-32.0) versus 27.0 months (95% CI, 19.75-34.24) for earlier and delayed CRT (P = .94). On multivariable analysis, delayed CRT was not associated with an overall survival difference (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.87-1.27; P = .60).

Also, pre-schoolers’ sleep timing was advanced before the lockdown and delayed during the lockdown relative to toddlers’. Our data highlight a significant modulation of age on the impact of the pandemic crisis on sleep, with pre-schoolers experiencing greater effects than toddlers.

Its clinical impact in immunocompetent children and in the context of coinfections remains unclear in Tunisia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: HAdV‐ARIs were studied in hospitalized patients from birth to the age of 5 years from 2013 to 2014. Clinical and demographic characteristics, coinfections, and molecular characterization of HAdV were established. RESULTS: HAdV‐positivity was detected in 114/583 specimens (19.6%) including 6.1% single infections and 93.9% coinfections. Adenoviral coinfections mostly comprised human Rhinovirus (50.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (34.2%), human Respiratory Syncytial virus A/B (29.8%), and human Coronaviruses (21.9%). HAdV infection was predominant in the pediatric population (25.0% vs 10.0% in neonates, P < .001) and peaked in February 2014 (21.1%). HAdV severity of pediatric cases is characterized by low saturation of oxygen (<94%, 33.8%, P = .05) and long duration of oxygen support (≥5 days, 32.7%, P = .02). Severe HAdV infections were described with S. pneumoniae coinfection, which seemed to increase the risk of death. HAdV genotyping identified HAdV‐C as the most common species. Severe ARIs were observed in all HAdV‐identified types. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that sequences were variable suggesting the circulation of different HAdV strains sharing more similarities to strains circulating in Europe or Asia than those from Africa.

Lipoabdominoplasty is one of the precarious aesthetic treatments with risk for thrombosis. COVID-19 convalescent patients may have an abnormally high rate of thrombotic events, which should be studied further. Patients with a history of COVID-19 infection who undergo the aesthetic procedure may have a greater risk of thrombosis than non-COVID-19 patients who undergo lipoabdominoplasty. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients who underwent lipoabdominoplasty were followed retrospectively for the occurrence of thrombotic events postoperatively and their relationship to previous COVID-19 infection. The study design comprised an examination of their medical records for prior COVID-19 infection, a history of thrombotic events before, during, or following COVID-19 infection, and D-dimer levels during and after COVID-19 infection. Thrombotic signs were studied in COVID-19 convalescent and non-COVID-19 patients following lipoabdominoplasty. The universal prophylactic measures for anticoagulation were followed.

METHODS: Data come from Waves 3 (Fall 2019) and 4 (Fall 2020) of the Policy and Communication Evaluation (PACE) Vermont, an online cohort study of adolescents (ages 12–17) and young adults (ages 18–25). Participants in Wave 4 (212 adolescents; 662 young adults) completed items on COVID‐related stressors, the impact of the pandemic on their substance use, brief mental health scales, and past 30‐day substance use. Analyses examined correlational and longitudinal relationships between COVID‐related stressors, mental health symptoms, and substance use. RESULTS: More than 60% of participants noted negative effects of the pandemic on their physical, emotional, and social well‐being, with greater impacts of COVID‐related stressors in young adults than adolescents. There were significant increases in depressive (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03, 1.66) and anxiety symptoms (OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.10, 1.64) in young adults between Fall 2019 and Fall 2020.

Data on the efficacy and safety of VR are variable and there are few predictors of successful outcome. This study aimed to examine whether or not an adverse obstetric history influenced the functional outcome following VR for ODS. METHOD This was a retrospective study of a cohort of 76 consecutive patients who had undergone VR for ODS at a tertiary referral centre between 2012 and 2015. Patients were followed up by telephone questionnaire. The obstetric history and pre- and postoperative symptoms of ODS and faecal incontinence (FI) were obtained from telephone interviews. RESULTS In this cohort, symptoms of ODS were significantly improved by surgery, with 56% of patients showing a reduction of symptoms of 50% or more (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that a lower body mass index (BMI; 24.4 vs 27.3 kg/m2 ; P < 0.05) and shorter duration of symptoms (7 vs 10 years; P < 0.05) led to a better outcome. VR had no effect on FI. Obstetric factors such as foetal weight, instrumental delivery, episiotomy, perineal tear and total number of deliveries did not influence outcomes. CONCLUSION Patients with a less straightforward obstetric history can be reassured that this should not adversely influence the functional outcome after VR for ODS.

apeh7ub4,,WHO,The SARS-CoV-2 Y453F mink variant displays a pronounced increase in ACE-2 affinity but does not challenge antibody neutralization,,,,unk,"SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to animals has been reported for many domesticated species, including farmed minks. The identification of novel spike gene mutations appearing in minks has raised major concerns about potential immune evasion and challenges for the global vaccine strategy. One genetic variant, known as ""cluster-five"", arose among farmed minks in Denmark and resulted in a complete shutdown of the world's largest mink production. However, the functional properties of this new variant are not established. Here we present functional data on the cluster-five variant, which contains a mutation resulting in a Y453F residue change in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Using an ELISA-based ACE-2/RBD inhibition assay, we show that the Y453F variant does not decrease established humoral immunity from previously infected individuals nor affect the neutralizing antibody response in a vaccine mouse model based on the original Wuhan strain RBD or spike as antigens. However, biolayer interferometry analysis demonstrates that it binds the human ACE-2 receptor with a four-fold higher affinity compared to the original strain suggesting an enhanced transmission capacity and a possible challenge for viral control. These results also indicate that the rise in frequency of the cluster-five variant in mink farms might be a result of the fitness advantage conferred by the receptor adaptation rather than evading immune responses.",2021,"Bayarri-Olmos, Rafael; Rosbjerg, Anne; Johnsen, Laust Bruun; Helgstrand, Charlotte; Bak-Thomsen, Theresa; Garred, Peter; Skjoedt, Mikkel-Ole",J Biol Chem,,#1126904,,,,,232200133.0

Both theoretical and experimental efforts are seeking to find an effective treatment to suppress the virus. In silico drug design can play a vital role in identifying promising drug candidates against COVID-19. Herein, we focused on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that has crucial biological functions in the virus. We performed a ligand-based virtual screening followed by a docking screening for testing approved drugs and bioactive compounds listed in the DrugBank and ChEMBL databases. The top 8 docking results were advanced to all-atom MD simulations to study the relative stability of the protein-ligand interactions. MD simulations support that the catalytic residue, His41, has a neutral side chain with a protonated delta position. An absolute binding energy (ΔG) of -42 kJ mol-1 for the protein-ligand (Mpro-N3) complex has been calculated using the potential-of-mean-force (geometrical) approach. Furthermore, the relative binding energies were computed for the top docking results. Our results suggest several promising approved and bioactive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as follows: a bioactive compound, ChEMBL275592, which has the best MM/GBSA binding energy; the second-best compound, montelukast, is an approved drug used in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis; the third-best compound, ChEMBL288347, is a bioactive compound. Bromocriptine and saquinavir are other approved drugs that also demonstrate stability in the active site of Mpro, albeit their relative binding energies are low compared to the N3 inhibitor.

METHODS: We conducted a case series analysis of news reports about electric scooter crashes occurring in Italy from January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020. Events were included when a road traffic accident involved an electric scooter and caused damages or injuries to the driver or others. RESULTS: We identified 96 road accidents involving electric scooters in Italy. The mean age of patients was 30 ± 16 years, and 79% (n = 71/90) were male. Of the 96 patients, only two (2%) were driving an electric scooter with a helmet, and three (3%) were driving while intoxicated.

While many investigational, approved, and repurposed drugs have been suggested, preclinical data from animal models can guide the search for effective treatments by ruling out treatments without in vivo efficacy. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity(1,2), that is currently investigated in COVID-19 clinical trials and recently received Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration(3,4). In animal models, remdesivir treatment was effective against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection.(2,5,6) In vitro, remdesivir inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2.(7,8) Here, we investigated the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in arhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection(9). In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs and reduced virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages 12hrs after the first treatment administration. Virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract was not reduced by remdesivir treatment. At necropsy, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were lower and there was a reduction in damage to the lungs. Thus, therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection had a clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques. Although the rhesus macaque model does not represent the severe disease observed in a proportion of COVID-19 patients, our data support early remdesivir treatment initiation in COVID-19 patients to prevent progression to pneumonia.",2020-06-09,"Williamson, Brandi N.; Feldmann, Friederike; Schwarz, Benjamin; Meade-White, Kimberly; Porter, Danielle P.; Schulz, Jonathan; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Leighton, Ian; Yinda, Claude Kwe; Pérez-Pérez, Lizzette; Okumura, Atsushi; Lovaglio, Jamie; Hanley, Patrick W.; Saturday, Greg; Bosio, Catharine M.; Anzick, Sarah; Barbian, Kent; Cihlar, Tomas; Martens, Craig; Scott, Dana P.; Munster, Vincent J.; de Wit, Emmie",Nature,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6c91e25d614ed7b33dab9f23169d319d8d36b0f1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7486271.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32516797/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2423-5,219564038.0

yyupc2i0,,WHO,Cellular and humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in immunosuppressed patients,,,,unk,"ObjectiveSARS-CoV-2 vaccinations have demonstrated vaccine immunogenicity in healthy volunteers, however, efficacy in immunosuppressed patients is less well characterised. Subsequently, there is an urgent need to address the impact of immunosuppression on vaccine immunogenicity. MethodsSerological, T-cell ELISpot, cytokines and immunophenotyping investigations were used to assess vaccine responses (either BNT162b2 mRNA or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in double-vaccinated patients receiving immunosuppression for renal transplants or haematological malignancies (n=13). Immunological responses in immunosuppressed patients (VACC-IS) were compared to immunocompetent vaccinated (VACC-IC, n=12), unvaccinated (UNVACC, n=11) and infection-naive unvaccinated (HC, n=3) cohorts. All participants, except HC, had prior COVID-19 infection. ResultsT-cell responses were identical between VACC-IS and VACC-IC (92%) to spike-peptide (S) stimulation. UNVACC had the highest T-cell non-responders (n=3), whereas VACC-IC and VACC-IS both had one T-cell non-responder. No significant differences in humoral responses were observed between VACC-IC and VACC-IS, with 92% (12/13) of VACC-IS patients demonstrating seropositivity. One VACC-IS failed to seroconvert, however had detectable T-cell responses. All VACC-IC participants were seropositive for anti-spike antibodies. Furthermore, both VACC-IS and VACC-IC participants elicited strong Th1 cytokine response with immunodominance towards S-peptide. Differences in T-cell immunophenotyping were seen between VACC-IS and VACC-IC, with lower CD8+ activation and T-effector memory phenotype observed in VACC-IS. ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 vaccines are immunogenic in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, with responses comparable to vaccinated immunocompetent participants. Lower humoral responses were seen in patients treated with B-cell depleting therapeutics, but with preserved T-cell responses. We suggest further work to correlate both protective immunity and longevity of these responses in both healthy and immunosuppressed patients.",2021,"Mohanraj, Dinesh; Baldwin, Samuel; Singh, Satbeer; Gordon, Alun; Whitelegg, Alison",,,#ppmedrxiv-21267250,,,,,244895097.0

Many policies, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society; however, their benefits cannot be directly observed and are currently understood only through process-based simulations2-4. Here we compile data on 1,700 local, regional and national non-pharmaceutical interventions that were deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and the United States. We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth5,6, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of approximately 38% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. Some policies have different effects on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages that were deployed to reduce the rate of transmission achieved large, beneficial and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections. These findings may help to inform decisions regarding whether or when these policies should be deployed, intensified or lifted, and they can support policy-making in the more than 180 other countries in which COVID-19 has been reported7.",2020,"Hsiang, Solomon; Allen, Daniel; Annan-Phan, Sébastien; Bell, Kendon; Bolliger, Ian; Chong, Trinetta; Druckenmiller, Hannah; Huang, Luna Yue; Hultgren, Andrew; Krasovich, Emma; Lau, Peiley; Lee, Jaecheol; Rolf, Esther; Tseng, Jeanette; Wu, Tiffany",Nature,,#592841,,,,,219552534.0

On the basis of the data from January 26 to February 11, 2020, we found that there were 11 areas with different types of temporal patterns of daily new confirmed cases. The pattern characterized by an increasing trend and abrupt change is mainly attributed to the improvement in the ability to diagnose the disease. Spatial clusters with high incidence rates during the period were concentrated in Wuhan Metropolitan Area due to the high intensity of spatial interaction of the population.

Furthermore, we test the moderation effect of perceived danger (contextual factor) on these relationships. To assess the hypotheses, three studies were conducted in different countries: (1) Iran, which is under intense economic sanctions;(2) Peru, which has dealt with severe restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic;and (3) Afghanistan, which is involved in a long-standing internal war. We tested the direct relationship between proactive personality and SRBs by using survey-based data from 292 employees in Iran and 306 employees in Peru. The moderation effect of perceived danger (contextual factor) is assessed using data from 172 employees in Afghanistan. Accordingly, we found a consistent pattern of relationships between employees’ proactive personalities and their involvement in both societal behaviors and sustainability-oriented behaviors in Iran and Peru.

zuxyn0f3,,WHO,Dystonia as a prominent presenting feature in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies: A case series,,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: Although there has been increasing recognition of the occurrence of non-epileptic involuntary movements in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), the spectrum of dystonic presentations associated with these conditions remains poorly described. We sought to expand the catalogue of dystonia-predominant phenotypes in monogenic DEEs, building on the recently introduced concept of an epilepsy-movement disorder spectrum. METHODS: Cases were identified from a whole-exome-sequenced cohort of 45 pediatric index patients with complex dystonia (67% sequenced as parent-child trios). Review of molecular findings in DEE-associated genes was performed. For five individuals with identified DEE-causing variants, detailed information about presenting phenotypic features and the natural history of disease was obtained. RESULTS: De-novo pathogenic and likely pathogenic missense variants in GABRA1, GABBR2, GNAO1, and FOXG1 gave rise to infantile-onset persistent and paroxysmal dystonic manifestations, beginning in the limb or truncal musculature and progressing gradually to a generalized state. Coexisting, less prominent movement-disorder symptoms were observed and included myoclonic, ballistic, and stereotypic abnormal movements as well as choreoathetosis. Dystonia dominated over epileptic neurodevelopmental comorbidities in all four subjects and represented the primary indication for molecular genetic analysis. We also report the unusual case of an adult female patient with dystonia, tremor, and mild learning disability who was found to harbor a pathogenic frameshift variant in MECP2. CONCLUSIONS: Dystonia can be a leading clinical manifestation in different DEEs. A monogenic basis of disease should be considered on the association of dystonia and developmental delay-epilepsy presentations, justifying a molecular screening for variants in DEE-associated genes.",2021,"Dzinovic, Ivana; Skorvánek, Matej; Necpál, Ján; Boesch, Sylvia; Svantnerová, Jana; Wagner, Matias; Havránková, Petra; Pavelekova, Petra; Han, Vladimír; Janzarik, Wibke G; Berweck, Steffen; Diebold, Isabel; Kuster, Alice; Jech, Robert; Winkelmann, Juliane; Zech, Michael",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,,#mdl-34399161,,,,,237149345.0

Prosocial and proself punishers were established with responses in advantage and disadvantage offers in the UG. Results showed that prosocial and proself punishers coexisted in the UG, and prosocial punishers were more likely to be prosocial in SVO and allocated more resources to the recipient in the DG than proself punishers, but differences in positive/negative reciprocity between prosocial and proself punishers were not found. Further regression analysis found that SVO type and generosity in the DG could predict the type of punishers in the UG, but not positive/negative reciprocity.

To improve understanding of dialysis staff transplant education practices, as well as the potential value of video, we conducted focus groups of dialysis center staff members in Buffalo, NY. METHODS/APPROACH Seventeen focus groups (97 participants: 53 nurses, 10 dialysis technicians, 6 social workers, 6 dieticians, 7 administrative personnel, 2 trainees, and 1 insurance coordinator) from 8 dialysis facilities in Buffalo, NY, were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. After thematic data analysis, a diverse patient and caregiver community advisory board was invited to comment, and their voices were integrated. Findings: Five key themes were identified that captured barriers to transplant education delivery and how online video could be a facilitator: (1) delivery of transplant education was reliant on one person, (2) other dialysis staff had time to answer transplant questions but felt uninformed, (3) patient lack of interest in existing supplementary transplant education, (4) patient disinterest in transplantation education was due to education timing, feeling overwhelmed, and transplant fear/ambivalence, and (5) video education could be flexible, low effort, and spark transplant interest. Study limitations are potential selection bias and inclusion of English-speaking participants only.

However, these seldom consider all aspects of disease management are not usually developed specifically for seniors or created for sustained use and are primarily focused on a single disease. We created an eHealth self-management application called ‘KeepWell’ that supports seniors with complex care needs in their homes. It incorporates the care for two or more chronic conditions from among the most prevalent high-burden chronic diseases. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will evaluate the effectiveness, cost and uptake of KeepWell in a 6-month, pragmatic, hybrid effectiveness–implementation randomised controlled trial. Older adults age ≥65 years with one or more chronic conditions who are English speaking are able to consent and have access to a computer or tablet device, internet and an email address will be eligible. All consenting participants will be randomly assigned to KeepWell or control. The allocation sequence will be determined using a random number generator. Primary outcome is perceived self-efficacy at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, health background/status, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity, caffeine, alcohol, smoking and bladder health), social engagement and connections, eHealth literacy; all collected via a Health Risk Questionnaire embedded within KeepWell (intervention) or a survey platform (control). Implementation outcomes will include reach, effectiveness, adoption, fidelity, implementation cost and sustainability. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been received from the North York General Hospital Research and Ethics Board. The study is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Ontario Ministry of Health. We will work with our team to develop a dissemination strategy which will include publications, presentations, plain language summaries and an end-of-grant meeting.

Community empowerment–based responses to the risk environment of FSWs have been associated with significant reductions in HIV and STI risk and associated risk behaviors; however, evaluations of US-based interventions targeting FSWs are limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe the design, implementation, and planned evaluation strategy of an ongoing comprehensive community-level intervention in Baltimore City, Maryland, which aims to improve HIV and STI risk and cumulative incidence among FSWs. The two intervention components are the SPARC (Sex Workers Promoting Action, Risk Reduction, and Community Mobilization) drop-in center and the accompanying comprehensive mobile outreach program. The mission of SPARC is to provide low-barrier harm reduction services to FSWs, with a special focus on women who sell sex and use drugs. Services are provided through a harm reduction framework and include reproductive health and sexual health care; medication-assisted treatment; legal aid; counseling; showers, lockers, and laundry; and the distribution of harm reduction tools, including naloxone and sterile drug use supplies (eg, cookers, cotton, syringes, and pipes). METHODS: The SPARC intervention is being evaluated through the EMERALD (Enabling Mobilization, Empowerment, Risk Reduction, and Lasting Dignity) study, which consists of a prospective 2-group comparative nonrandomized trial (n=385), a cross-sectional survey (n=100), and in-depth interviews assessing SPARC implementation (n=45). Participants enrolled in the nonrandomized trial completed a survey and HIV and STI testing at 4 intervals (baseline and 6, 12, and 18 months). Participants recruited from predefined areas closest to SPARC comprised the intervention group, and participants from all other areas of Baltimore were included in the control group. RESULTS: We hypothesize that addressing structural drivers and more immediate medical needs, in combination with peer outreach, will improve the HIV and STI risk environment, leading to community empowerment, and reduce the HIV and STI cumulative incidence and behavioral risks of FSWs. Data collection is ongoing. A baseline description of the cohort is presented. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, structural interventions aimed at reducing HIV and STIs among FSWs are scarce; to our knowledge, this is the first intervention of its kind in the United States. The results of the EMERALD study can be used to inform the development of future interventions targeting FSWs and other at-risk populations.

We conducted a study among the lay public in Wuhan to access their support, understanding of, compliance with, and the psychological impacts of the quarantine. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, online-based survey study between January 28, 2020, and February 2, 2020 among the adult lay public in Wuhan to access their support, understanding of, compliance with, and the psychological impacts of the quarantine. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify factors associated with psychological impacts. RESULTS: Among the 4100 participants investigated, a total of 15.9% were compliant with all the five household prevention measures, whereas 74.4% were compliant with all the three community prevention measures investigated. By demographics, participants of younger age, higher income, residing in an urban area, knowing neighbors infected with COVID-19 reported significantly higher psychological impact score. Participants with a lower level of support for quarantine were more likely to have a higher psychological impact score (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96). Participants with a lower level of compliance with preventive measures (score of 0-19) reported higher psychological impact (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.22-1.60 vs. score 20-24). Participants who had been out of house socializing and attended public events expressed higher psychological impact. CONCLUSIONS: Support, understanding of the rationale for quarantine are essential in ensuring appropriate psychological well-being during the quarantine.

All four fluoroquinolones suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication at high micromolar concentrations in both cell types, with enoxacin demonstrating the lowest effective concentration 50 value (EC(50)) of 126.4 μM in Vero cells. Enoxacin also suppressed the replication of MERS-CoV-2 in Vero cells at high micromolar concentrations. Cellular toxicity of levofloxacin was not found in either cell type. In Vero cells, minimal toxicity was observed following treatment with ≥37.5 μM enoxacin and 600 μM ciprofloxacin. Toxicity in both cell types was detected after moxifloxacin treatment of ≥300 μM.

During the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting coronavirus disease (COVID-19), social distance has been imposed worldwide to limit the spread of the virus. An additional deliberate intention of keeping a minimum safety distance from neighbors can fundamentally alter the “social force” between individuals. Here, we introduce a new “social distance” term inspired by gas molecular dynamics and integrate it into an existing agent-based social force model to describe the dynamics of crowds under social-distanced conditions. The advantage of this “social distance” term over the simple increasing of the repulsive range of other alternatives is that the fundamental crowd properties are precisely described by our model parameters. We compare the new model with the Helbing and Molnar’s classical model and experimental data, and show that this new model is superior in reproducing experimental data.

We sought to capture and synthesize information about changes to routine immunization programs in response to the pandemic and plans to catch-up any missed immunizations. METHODS: Provincial/territorial (P/T) public health leaders were interviewed via teleconference between August-October 2020 to collect information on the following topics: how routine immunization delivery was affected during and after initial lockdown periods, plans to catch-up missed doses, and major challenges and achievements in continuing routine immunization programs. Data were coded and categorized according to common responses and descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: Interviews occurred with participants from 11 of 13 P/Ts. School immunization programs were reported to be most negatively affected by the pandemic (n = 9). In the early pandemic period, infant, preschool, and maternal/prenatal programs were prioritized, with most P/Ts continuing these services with adaptations for COVID-19. After the initial lockdown period, all routine programs were continuing with adaptations in most P/Ts. Infant, preschool, and school programs were most often targeted for catch-up through measures such as appointment rebooking and making additional clinics and/or providers available. Major challenges included resource limitations (e.g., staff shortages, PPE shortages, limited infrastructure) (n = 11), public health restrictions (n = 8), and public hesitancy to attend appointments (n = 5).

The general concept of studying virus structure in association with the host cell has recently been expanded to reveal interactions between viruses and the cytoskeleton. The procedure permits utilization of immuno-gold protocols using both the transmission and scanning electron microscopes. The grid-cell-culture technique is reviewed to explain how it can be exploited to provide valuable information about virus structure and replication in both diagnostic and research laboratories. The use of the technique at the research level is discussed using bluetongue virus as a model.

In this cross-sectional analysis, we investigated the seroprevalence among a police cohort, and sociodemographic, work, and health-related factors associated with seropositivity. METHODS: Study participants were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 and to complete online questionnaires. Serum neutralization titers toward the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (expressing D614G) and the Alpha and Beta variants were measured in seropositive study participants. RESULTS: A total of 978 police personnel representing 35% of the entire staff participated from February to March 2021. The seroprevalence was 12.9%. It varied by geographic region, ranged from 9% to 13.5% in 3 regions, including the city; and was 22% in Bernese Seeland/Jura with higher odds for seropositivity (odds ratio [OR], 2.38 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.28–4.44], P=.006). Job roles with mainly office activity were associated with a lower risk of seropositivity (OR, 0.33 [95% CI, .14–.77], P=.010). Self-reported compliance with mask wearing during working hours was 100%; 45% of seropositive vs 5% of seronegative participants (P<.001) reported having had contact with a proven coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case living in the same household prior to serological testing. The level of serum antibody titers correlated with neutralization capacity. Antibodies derived from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection effectively neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but were less effective against the Alpha and Beta variants. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of police officers was comparable to that reported in the general population, suggesting that the personal protective equipment of the police is effective, and that household contacts are the leading transmission venues. The level of serum antibody titers, in particular that of anti-spike antibodies, correlated well with neutralization capacity. Low antibody titers acquired from natural infection were not effective against variants.

COVID-19 eventually spread to almost all countries and has now been declared a global pandemic disease by the World Health Organisation. A plethora of research has explored the dynamics of different clinical entities related to SARS-COV-2, in particular, COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. A large scale of patients have been reported to have developed pulmonary embolism without any other standard triggers or risk factors, leading to speculation that COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism. In addition to the development of thromboembolic complications such as pulmonary embolism, COVID-19 has also been reported to have triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); however, it is unclear whether pulmonary embolism was due to COVID-19-induced thrombosis or a result of coagulopathy secondary to DIC. We describe a unique case of a COVID-19 associated coagulopathy in a patient with confirmed pulmonary embolism along with an overt DIC. Following diagnosis, the challenge was to identify the appropriate treatment modality for this unique situation. The patient was treated with anticoagulants and steroids along with blood products.

We used a highly sensitive and specific assay to explore the presence of N-Ag in urine during the course of Covid-19, and explore its relationship with the severity of the disease. METHODS: We studied urine and blood N-Ag using highly sensitive immunoassay in 82 patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection proven by PCR. RESULTS: In the first and second weeks of Covid-19, hospitalized patients tested positive for urinary N-Ag (81.25% and 71.79%, respectively), and blood N-Ag (93.75% and 94.87%, respectively). High urinary N-Ag levels were associated with the absence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies, admission in intensive care units, high C-reactive protein levels, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and high lactate dehydrogenase. A higher accuracy was observed for urine N-Ag as a predictor of severe Covid-19 compared to blood N-Ag. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrate that N-Ag is present in the urine of patients hospitalized in the early phase of Covid-19.

One such option is vitamin D, in the form of vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) supplementation, due to its potential antiviral properties. It has become apparent that older individuals have a greater risk of developing severe COVID-19, and compared to younger adults, the elderly have lower levels of vitamin D due to a variety of biological and behavioral factors. Older adults are also more likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD), with advanced age being the single greatest risk factor. In addition to its immune-system-modulating effects, it has been suggested that vitamin D supplementation plays a role in slowing PD progression and improving PD-related quality of life. We completed a review of the literature to determine the relationship between vitamin D, PD, and COVID-19.

Pandemics at the scale of COVID-19 can cause a global shortage of proprietary commercial reagents and BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently needed to address these challenges. An open-source method, magnetic-nanoparticle-aided viral RNA isolation from contagious samples (MAVRICS), built upon readily available reagents, and easily assembled in any basically equipped laboratory, is thus developed. The performance of MAVRICS is evaluated using validated pathogen detection assays and real-world and contrived samples. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in samples inactivated in phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. MAVRICS allows wastewater biomass immobilized on membranes to be directly inactivated and lysed in TRIzol followed by RNA extraction by magnetic nanoparticles, thereby greatly reducing biohazard risk and simplifying processing procedures. Using 39 COVID-19 patient samples and two wastewater samples, it is shown that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus.

i3262s96,,WHO,Social media based surveillance systems for healthcare using machine learning: A systematic review,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Real-time surveillance in the field of health informatics has emerged as a growing domain of interest among worldwide researchers. Evolution in this field has helped in the introduction of various initiatives related to public health informatics. Surveillance systems in the area of health informatics utilizing social media information have been developed for early prediction of disease outbreaks and to monitor diseases. In the past few years, the availability of social media data, particularly Twitter data, enabled real-time syndromic surveillance that provides immediate analysis and instant feedback to those who are charged with follow-ups and investigation of potential outbreaks. In this paper, we review the recent work, trends, and machine learning(ML) text classification approaches used by surveillance systems seeking social media data in the healthcare domain. We also highlight the limitations and challenges followed by possible future directions that can be taken further in this domain. METHODS: To study the landscape of research in health informatics performing surveillance of the various health-related data posted on social media or web-based platforms, we present a bibliometric analysis of the 1240 publications indexed in multiple scientific databases (IEEE, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, PubMed) from the year 2010-2018. The papers were further reviewed based on the various machine learning algorithms used for analyzing health-related text posted on social media platforms. FINDINGS: Based on the corpus of 148 selected articles, the study finds the types of social media or web-based platforms used for surveillance in the healthcare domain, along with the health topic(s) studied by them. In the corpus of selected articles, we found 26 articles were using machine learning technique. These articles were studied to find commonly used ML techniques. The majority of studies (24%) focused on the surveillance of flu or influenza-like illness (ILI). Twitter (64%) is the most popular data source to perform surveillance research using social media text data, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (33%) being the most used ML algorithm for text classification. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of online data in surveillance systems has improved the disease prediction ability over traditional syndromic surveillance systems. However, social media based surveillance systems have many limitations and challenges, including noise, demographic bias, privacy issues, etc. Our paper mentions future directions, which can be useful for researchers working in the area. Researchers can use this paper as a library for social media based surveillance systems in the healthcare domain and can expand such systems by incorporating the future works discussed in our paper.",2020,"Gupta, Aakansha; Katarya, Rahul",J Biomed Inform,,#628194,,,,,220305064.0

The impact of polymicrobial ICUAP is not extensively known. We therefore investigated the characteristics and outcomes of polymicrobial aetiology of ICUAP. METHOD: Patients with ICUAP confirmed microbiologically were prospectively compared according to identification of 1 (monomicrobial) or more (polymicrobial) potentially-pathogenic microorganisms. Microbes usually considered as non-pathogenic were not considered for the etiologic diagnosis. We assessed clinical characteristics, microbiology, inflammatory biomarkers and outcome variables. RESULTS: Among 441 consecutive patients with ICUAP, 256 (58 %) had microbiologic confirmation, and 41 (16 %) of them polymicrobial pneumonia. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and several Enterobacteriaceae were more frequent in polymicrobial pneumonia. Multi-drug and extensive-drug resistance was similarly frequent in both groups. Compared with monomicrobial, patients with polymicrobial pneumonia had less frequently chronic heart disease (6, 15 % vs. 71, 33 %, p = 0.019), and more frequently pleural effusion (18, 50 %, vs. 54, 25 %, p = 0.008), without any other significant difference. Appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment was similarly frequent in the monomicrobial (185, 86 %) and the polymicrobial group (39, 95 %), as were the initial response to the empiric treatment, length of stay and mortality. Systemic inflammatory response was similar comparing monomicrobial with polymicrobial ICUAP. CONCLUSION: The aetiology of ICUAP confirmed microbiologically was polymicrobial in 16 % cases.

Overall, the greatest increase in COVID-19 incidence was in northern Colorado, i.e., Weld County, which reported the highest rates in the Urban Front Range. Social and health determinants associated with higher COVID-19-related deaths were population density and asthma, indicative of urban areas, and poverty and unemployment, suggestive of rural areas.

Exercise has been shown to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, physical functioning, body composition, fatigue, and quality of life during and after treatment; however, to date only 1 exercise study has been conducted in this clinical setting. Objective To examine the effects of exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness and biochemical progression in men with prostate cancer who were undergoing active surveillance. Design, Setting, and Participants The Exercise During Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer (ERASE) trial was a single-center, 2-group, phase 2 randomized clinical trial conducted at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. Eligible patients were recruited from July 24, 2018, to February 5, 2020. Participants were adult men who were diagnosed with localized very low risk to favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer and undergoing active surveillance. They were randomized to either the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) group or usual care group. All statistical analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Interventions The HIIT group was asked to complete 12 weeks of thrice-weekly, supervised aerobic sessions on a treadmill at 85% to 95% of peak oxygen consumption (V̇o2). The usual care group maintained their normal exercise levels. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was peak V̇o2, which was assessed as the highest value of oxygen uptake during a graded exercise test using a modified Bruce protocol. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were indicators of biochemical progression of prostate cancer, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and PSA kinetics, and growth of prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Results A total of 52 male patients, with a mean (SD) age of 63.4 (7.1) years, were randomized to either the HIIT (n = 26) or usual care (n = 26) groups. Overall, 46 of 52 participants (88%) completed the postintervention peak V̇o2 assessment, and 49 of 52 participants (94%) provided blood samples. Adherence to HIIT was 96%. The primary outcome of peak V̇o2 increased by 0.9 mL/kg/min in the HIIT group and decreased by 0.5 mL/kg/min in the usual care group (adjusted between-group mean difference (1.6 mL/kg/min; 95% CI, 0.3-2.9; P = .01). Compared with the usual care group, the HIIT group experienced decreased PSA level (-1.1 μg/L; 95% CI, -2.1 to 0.0; P = .04), PSA velocity (-1.3 μg /L/y; 95% CI, -2.5 to -0.1; P = .04), and LNCaP cell growth (-0.13 optical density unit; 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.02; P = .02). No statistically significant differences were found in PSA doubling time or testosterone. Conclusions and Relevance The ERASE trial demonstrated that HIIT increased cardiorespiratory fitness levels and decreased PSA levels, PSA velocity, and prostate cancer cell growth in men with localized prostate cancer who were under active surveillance. Larger trials are warranted to determine whether such improvement translates to better longer-term clinical outcomes in this setting.

The most common form of toxic effects of APAP is in the liver where phosphatidylcholine is the major component of the cell membrane with additional associated functionalities. Although this is the case, the effects of APAP on pure phospholipid membranes have been largely ignored. Here, we used 1,2-di-(octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), a commonly found phospholipid in mammalian cell membranes, to synthesize large unilamellar vesicles to investigate how the incorporation of APAP changes the pure lipid vesicle structure, morphology, and fluidity at different concentrations. We used a combination of dynamic light scattering, small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS), and cryo-TEM for structural characterization, and neutron spin-echo (NSE) spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics. We showed that the incorporation of APAP in the lipid bilayer significantly impacts the spherical phospholipid self-assembly in terms of its morphology and influences the lipid content in the bilayer, causing a decrease in bending rigidity. We observe a decrease in the number of lipids per vesicle by almost 28% (0.06 wt % APAP) and 19% (0.12 wt % APAP) compared to the pure DOPC (0 wt % APAP). Our results showed that the incorporation of APAP reduces the membrane rigidity by almost 50% and changes the spherical unilamellar vesicles into much more irregularly shaped vesicles. Although the bilayer structure did not show much change when observed by SAXS, NSE and cryo-TEM results showed the lipid dynamics change with the addition of APAP in the bilayer, which causes the overall decreased membrane rigidity. A strong effect on the lipid tail motion showed that the space explored by the lipid tails increases by a factor of 1.45 (for 0.06 wt % APAP) and 1.75 (for 0.12 wt % APAP) compared to DOPC without the drug.",2021-07-30,"De Mel, Judith U; Gupta, Sudipta; Harmon, Sydney; Stingaciu, Laura; Roth, Eric W; Siebenbuerger, Miriam; Bleuel, Markus; Schneider, Gerald J",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c01458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328747/,235352585.0

There is a relation between aged dental pulp and the senescence of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Therefore, it is important to investigate the molecular processes underlying the senescence of DPSCs to elucidate the dental pulp aging mechanisms. p-Cresol (PC), a uremic toxin, is strongly related to cellular senescence. Here, age-related phenotypic changes including senescence, apoptosis, inflammation, and declining odontoblast differentiation in PC-treated canine DPSCs were investigated. Under the PC condition, cellular senescence was induced by decreased proliferation capacity and increased cell size, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, and senescence markers p21, IL-1β, IL-8, and p53. Exposure to PC could stimulate inflammation by the increased expression of IL-6 and cause the distraction of the cell cycle by the increased level of Bax protein and decreased Bcl-2. The levels of odontoblast differentiation markers, dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix protein 1, and osterix, were decreased. Consistent with those findings, the alizarin red staining, alkaline phosphatase, and DSPP protein level were decreased during the odontoblast differentiation process. Taken together, these findings indicate that PC could induce cellular senescence in DPSCs, which may demonstrate the changes in aging dental pulp.",2020-09-21,"Zayed, Mohammed; Iohara, Koichiro",Int J Mol Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/13b8ecd5cbedf46cb1bc94d6e4a09ea1103169d9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7555360.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555360/,

r725voup,,Medline,An innovative rapid response radiotherapy program to reduce waiting time for palliative radiotherapy.,,,15856333.0,unk,"BACKGROUND Waiting for radiation therapy (RT) in Ontario has been a major problem for the past decade. In 1996, the Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre (TSRCC) initiated a Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program (RRRP) to provide timely palliative RT for symptom relief of patients with terminal cancer. PURPOSE This study reviews the clinical activity of the RRRP over the past 8 years to evaluate if we are meeting the objectives of the program. MATERIALS AND METHODS From the TSRCC oncology patient information system (OPIS) database, we retrieved the number of patients referred to the RRRP, their demographics, diagnosis and treatment for the calendar years 1996 to 2003 inclusive. We calculated the time interval between referral to consultation, consultation to simulation and the percentage of cases who started RT on their initial consultation for all new cases referred to the RRRP. RESULTS From 1996 to 2003, the number of cases seen in consultation increased from just over 200 cases annually in the first 2 years to about 500 cases per year in the last 4 years, for a total of 3,290. There were 1,792 (54%) men and 1,498 (46%) women; median age was 69 years (range, 21-95 years). Breast, lung, genitourinary and gastrointestinal primaries accounted for over 80% of all referrals. The majority was referred for palliative treatment of symptomatic bone (70%) or brain (14%) metastases. The dose fractionation for bone metastases was a single 8-Gy fraction in 45%, 20 Gy in five fractions in 42%, 30 Gy in ten fractions in 4% and other dose fractionations in 9%. Nearly 90% were seen within 2 weeks of referral (38% within 1 week). Eighty-five percent were simulated on the day of their initial consultation. Sixty percent started their RT treatment on the day of their consultation visit. The overall median interval from referral to treatment was 8 days. CONCLUSION Over the past 8 years, the annual number of new cases referred to the RRRP has doubled. The overall median interval from referral to consultation was 8 days. Sixty percent were simulated, planned and started treatment on the day of their initial consultation. We therefore are meeting our goal of providing rapid access to palliative RT for symptomatic cancer patients.",2006,"Danjoux, C; Chow, E; Drossos, A; Holden, L; Hayter, C; Tsao, M; Barnes, T; Sinclair, E; Farhadian, M",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15856333/,24787156.0

We describe in detail, the methodology of a single pulse TMS protocol that was performed in a large cohort of people (n = 110) with multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim was to establish and validate a core-set of TMS variables that predicted typical MS clinical outcomes: walking speed, hand dexterity, fatigue, and cognitive processing speed. We provide a brief and simple methodological pipeline to examine excitatory and inhibitory corticospinal mechanisms in MS that map to clinical status. Delayed and longer ipsilateral silent period (a measure of transcallosal inhibition; the influence of one brain hemisphere's activity over the other), longer cortical silent period (suggestive of greater corticospinal inhibition via GABA) and higher resting motor threshold (lower corticospinal excitability) most strongly related to clinical outcomes, especially when measured in the hemisphere corresponding to the weaker hand. Greater interhemispheric asymmetry (imbalance between hemispheres) correlated with poorer performance in the greatest number of clinical outcomes. We also show, not surprisingly, that TMS variables related more strongly to motor outcomes than non-motor outcomes. As it was validated in a large sample of patients with varying severities of central nervous system dysfunction, the protocol described herein can be used by investigators and clinicians alike to investigate the role of TMS as a biomarker in MS and other central nervous system disorders.",2021-03-17,"Chaves, Arthur R; Snow, Nicholas J; Alcock, Lynsey R; Ploughman, Michelle",Brain sciences,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11030384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803028/,232381559.0

Because standard approaches to understand TMEM106B at the sequence level find no homology to other proteins, it has remained a protein of unknown function. Here, the standard tool PSI-BLAST was used in a nonstandard way to show that the lumenal portion of TMEM106B is a member of the late embryogenesis abundant-2 (LEA-2) domain superfamily. More sensitive tools (HMMER, HHpred, and trRosetta) extended this to predict LEA-2 domains in two yeast proteins. One is Vac7, a regulator of PI(3,5)P2 production in the degradative vacuole, equivalent to the lysosome, which has a LEA-2 domain in its lumenal domain. The other is Tag1, another vacuolar protein, which signals to terminate autophagy and has three LEA-2 domains in its lumenal domain. Further analysis of LEA-2 structures indicated that LEA-2 domains have a long, conserved lipid-binding groove.

RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus was significantly related to the survival of hospitalized patients (P = 0.021). The rest of the investigated variables were not significant. The frailty effect was significant (P = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: In the investigated sample of patients with COVID-19, diabetes was an important variable related to patient survival.

The whole world is struggling hard to contain the spread of virus but finding it difficult, as new mutations and variants are taking shape continuously. Many mathematical models have been designed to predict spread of COVID-19, but prediction fails due to evolution of virus as well as its behavior. WHO provided many guidelines to prevent spread of COVID-19 which includes social distancing, wearing of masks in public places and frequent sensitization of hands. Wearing of mask has been proved to be the most effective in preventing the spread of corona virus. Wearing masks perhaps is the most important life style change which could help contain the spread of virus specially in offices, malls, theaters, restaurants and other public places. Though the administration frequently issues guidelines to wear masks but it is really very difficult to identify the peoples without mask in large gatherings.

Local, population-level, real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness is accumulating. We assessed vaccine effectiveness for community-dwelling New York City (NYC) residents using a quasi-experimental, regression discontinuity design, leveraging a period (January 12–March 9, 2021) when ≥65-year-olds were vaccine-eligible but younger persons, excluding essential workers, were not. METHODS: We constructed segmented, negative binomial regression models of age-specific COVID-19 hospitalization rates among 45–84-year-old NYC residents during a post-vaccination program implementation period (February 21–April 17, 2021), with a discontinuity at age 65 years. The relationship between age and hospitalization rates in an unvaccinated population was incorporated using a pre-implementation period (December 20, 2020–February 13, 2021). We calculated the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the interaction between implementation period (pre or post) and age-based eligibility (45–64 or 65–84 years). Analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity and borough of residence. Similar analyses were conducted for COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: Hospitalization rates among 65–84-year-olds decreased from pre- to post-implementation periods (RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74–0.97), controlling for trends among 45–64-year-olds. Accordingly, an estimated 721 (95% CI: 126–1,241) hospitalizations were averted. Residents just above the eligibility threshold (65–66-year-olds) had lower hospitalization rates than those below (63–64-year-olds). Racial/ethnic groups and boroughs with higher vaccine coverage generally experienced greater reductions in RR point estimates. Uncertainty was greater for the decrease in COVID-19 death rates (RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66–1.10). CONCLUSION: The vaccination program in NYC reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations among the initially age-eligible ≥65-year-old population by approximately 15% in the first eight weeks. The real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness makes it more imperative to improve vaccine access and uptake to reduce inequities in COVID-19 outcomes.",2021-12-22,"Greene, Sharon K.; Levin-Rector, Alison; McGibbon, Emily; Baumgartner, Jennifer; Devinney, Katelynn; Ternier, Alexandra; Sell, Jessica; Kahn, Rebecca; Kishore, Nishant",Vaccine X,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c3b210f07c87ef96da75feffd7544748e38a0e48.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8694652.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590136221000516; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvacx.2021.100134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34961848/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590136221000516?v=s5,245444235.0

An 85-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma initially received lenvatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, but the drug was later switched to bevacizumab-atezolizumab combination therapy owing to disease progression. After five cycles, he developed dyspnea and diffuse ground-glass opacities, which improved with discontinuation of the combination therapy and initiation of steroid pulse therapy. Our case findings indicate that both ICIs and anti-angiogenesis inhibitors cause drug-induced DAH, and their combination may increase the severity of DAH.

It is unknown whether anticoagulation can prevent these complications and improve outcome. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the question: What is the effect of (prophylactic and therapeutic dose) anticoagulation therapy in COVID-19 patients on cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications and clinical outcome? Relevant outcome measures were mortality (crucial), hospital admission, length of stay, thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attack), need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy. Medline and Embase databases were searched with relevant search terms until 17 July 2020. After systematic analysis, eight studies were included. Analysis was stratified for the start of anticoagulation before or during hospital admission. RESULTS: There was insufficient evidence that therapeutic anticoagulation could improve the outcome in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. None of the studies demonstrated improved mortality, except for one very small Italian study. Furthermore, none of the studies showed a positive effect of anticoagulation on other outcome measures in COVID-19, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, thromboembolic complications, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure or need for renal replacement therapy, except for two studies demonstrating an association between anticoagulation and a lower incidence of pulmonary embolism. However, the level of evidence of all studies varied from 'low' to 'very low', according to the GRADE methodology.

The CESD-R was applied to 398 community-dwelling people (191 men: 48.0%, and 207 women: 52.0%) who were over 40 years old. The Japanese version of the CES-D was also carried out in the same population. Factor analysis was performed. Additionally, the correlations between the CESD-R and CES-D results were identified. The CESD-R scores showed a significantly positive correlation with CES-D scores (r = 0.74, p < 0.0005). Analysis of the CESD-R yielded a Cronbach’s alpha result of 0.90. Factor analysis revealed one principal factor in the CESD-R, whereas the original CES-D had two factors because of reversed items.

In this paper, we report work in progress involving the development of an IoT-based COVID-19 health monitoring system that can effectively monitor the essential physiological functions of a patient through wireless sensors, thus supporting the early detection of severe cases and the continuous assessment of the patient status. The work provides several main contributions, as it includes: (i) a brief description of the current IoT-based system for remote monitoring of COVID-19 patients;(ii) a description of embedded characteristics of our device, including its contextual functions, early warning score mechanisms and self-adaptive features;and (iii) a description of our preliminary experiment results. Our proposed solution reduced drastically the amount of redundancy in data and still maintain monitoring accuracy. Given the COVID-19 scenarios, in which human resources are extended to the limit and the number of patients in severe conditions is often high, a system that can support IoT-based continuous monitoring are essential to identify changes in clinical status promptly and accurately and can potentially transform the way patients are monitored. © 2021 IEEE.",2021,"Paganelli, A.

This article reviews inactivation data of coronaviruses on surfaces and in liquids from published studies and develops secondary models to predict coronaviruses inactivation as a function of temperature and relative humidity. A total of 102 D-values (time to obtain a log10 reduction of virus infectivity), including values for SARS-CoV-2, were collected from 26 published studies. The values obtained from the different coronaviruses and studies were found to be generally consistent. Five different models were fitted to the global dataset of D-values. The most appropriate model considered temperature and relative humidity. A spreadsheet predicting the inactivation of coronaviruses and the associated uncertainty is presented and can be used to predict virus inactivation for untested temperatures, time points or any coronavirus strains belonging to Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera.Importance: The prediction of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on fomites is essential to investigate the importance of contact transmission. This study collects available information on inactivation kinetics of coronaviruses in both solid and liquid fomites and creates a mathematical model for the impact of temperature and relative humidity on virus persistence. The predictions of the model can support more robust decision-making and could be useful in various public health contexts. Having a calculator for the natural clearance of SARS-CoV-2 depending on temperature and relative humidity could be a valuable operational tool for public authorities.",2020,"Guillier, Laurent; Martin-Latil, Sandra; Chaix, Estelle; Thébault, Anne; Pavio, Nicole; Le Poder, Sophie; Batéjat, Christophe; Biot, Fabrice; Koch, Lionel; Schaffner, Don; Sanaa, Moez",,,#32680860,,,,,220629492.0

Prediction models that accurately estimate mortality risk in hospitalized patients could assist medical staff in treatment and allocating limited resources. AimsTo externally validate two promising previously published risk scores that predict in-hospital mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. MethodsTwo cohorts were available; a cohort of 1028 patients admitted to one of nine hospitals in Lombardy, Italy (the Lombardy cohort) and a cohort of 432 patients admitted to a hospital in Leiden, the Netherlands (the Leiden cohort). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. All patients were adult and tested COVID-19 PCR-positive. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. ResultsThe C-statistic of the 4C mortality score was good in the Lombardy cohort (0.85, 95CI: 0.82-0.89) and in the Leiden cohort (0.87, 95CI: 0.80-0.94). Model calibration was acceptable in the Lombardy cohort but poor in the Leiden cohort due to the model systematically overpredicting the mortality risk for all patients. The C-statistic of the CURB-65 score was good in the Lombardy cohort (0.80, 95CI: 0.75-0.85) and in the Leiden cohort (0.82, 95CI: 0.76-0.88). The mortality rate in the CURB-65 development cohort was much lower than the mortality rate in the Lombardy cohort. A similar but less pronounced trend was found for patients in the Leiden cohort.

Specifically, it facilitates positive appraisals of the pandemic, which then facilitate job satisfaction. Enhanced job satisfaction in turn reduces counterproductive work behavior during the pandemic. These arguments were tested via two empirical studies involving 546 Hong Kong employees surveyed on two consecutive working days during the pandemic. The individuals who made wishes during the pandemic reported more positive appraisals of the pandemic, which in turn promoted their job satisfaction and lowered their counterproductive work behavior. Crucially, wish-making had significant effects on positive appraisals above and beyond other coping strategies. Thus, we contribute to the employee coping literature by highlighting one relatively easy way for employees to combat the psychological effects of the pandemic (and other challenges in life) and regulate their affective well-being and behaviors at work.

OBJECTIVES: In this study we investigated whether the circulation of different respiratory virus infections in Austria, as assessed by the established respiratory virus surveillance system, is affected by these measures as well and may reflect the success of the lockdown in limiting respiratory virus transmission. STUDY DESIGN: Sentinel data obtained for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus cases were analyzed and compared between the season 2019/2020 and the five previous seasons. RESULTS: We observed a rapid and statistically significant reduction of cumulative cases for all these viruses within short time after the lockdown in March 2020, compared to previous seasons (each p < 0.001). Also, sentinel screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections was performed and a decrease of SARS-CoV-2 was seen after the lockdown. While for the seasonally occurring viruses as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus the lockdown led to the end of the annual epidemics, a re-increase of rhinovirus infections was observed after liberalization of numerous lockdown measures. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that occurrence of different respiratory virus infections reflect not only the efficiency of lockdown measures taken against SARS-CoV-2 but it shows also the effects of lockdown releases on the transmission of respiratory viruses.",2021,"Redlberger-Fritz, Monika; Kundi, Michael; Aberle, Stephan W; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth",J Clin Virol,,#1135438,,,,,232245933.0

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine YouTube videos posted in response to a sudden spate of student suicides in Hong Kong during the 2015-2016 school year and evaluate the impacts of those videos. METHODS: Keyword search was performed on YouTube, and relevant videos were identified. Video typology was examined through content analysis, specifically grouping the videos by who uploaded the videos, what presentation formats were used in the videos, whether the videos were originally created by the uploaders, and whether the videos disclosed the uploaders’ personal experiences with suicide. Impacts of the videos were assessed in terms of reach (measured by view count), engagement (measured by comment count), and insights (measured as to what extent the comments to each video could reveal personal suicide risk and attitude toward help-seeking). Statistical analysis was conducted to compare the impacts of different types of videos. The 7 most impactful videos that were originally created by the YouTubers were selected for further analysis. They were compared with 7 videos uploaded by the same YouTubers right before the student suicide videos and 7 right after the student suicide videos. The comparison focused on their impacts and the network structure of the comments to those videos. RESULTS: A total of 162 relevant YouTube videos were identified. They were uploaded by 7 types of stakeholders, and the most common format was one person talking to the camera. A total of 87.0% (141/162) of the videos were originally created by the uploaders and only 8.0% (13/162) of the videos disclosed uploader personal experiences with suicide. The uploader profiles being popular or top YouTubers and the video containing disclosure of the uploader’s personal experiences were found to be significantly correlated with greater impacts (P<.001). Focusing on the 7 most impactful original videos, it is found that those videos generated more engagement, especially more interactions between the viewers, and more insights than regular videos uploaded by the same YouTubers. CONCLUSIONS: When responding to a youth suicide crisis, videos made by key opinion leaders on YouTube sharing their own experiences of overcoming suicide risks could generate significant positive impacts. These types of videos offer a precious opportunity to craft online campaigns and activities to raise suicide prevention awareness and engage vulnerable youth.",2021-06-18,"Cheng, Qijin; Lui, Carrie; Ip, Flora Wai Lam; Yip, Paul Siu Fai",JMIR Ment Health,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8277376.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8277376/,

Indeed, patients with asthma and allergy appear underrepresented in large reports of COVID-19 cases worldwide. In this review, we evaluate existing literature on this topic and potential underlying mechanisms for any interrelationship between asthma and COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS Data from several preclinical and clinical reports suggest a lower susceptibility for COVID-19 in patients with underlying type 2 airway inflammation including asthma that may be related to a reduced expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Corticosteroids further decrease expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, hence may also have a protective effect against infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, some studies suggest that the reported improvement in asthma control and a reduction in asthma exacerbations during the COVID-19 pandemic may be related to improvement in adherence to controller therapy and reduced exposure to triggers, such as other respiratory viruses and air pollutants. Recent data point towards differential susceptibility for COVID-19 among asthma patients based on their phenotype and/or endotype. On the basis of existing evidence, continuation with controller therapies is recommended for all patients with asthma. For patients with severe uncontrolled asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2, adjustment of controllers and biologics should be based on a multidisciplinary decision. SUMMARY Underrepresentation of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with asthma and related allergic diseases may be based on potentially protective underlying mechanisms, such as type 2 airway inflammation, downregulation of ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptors, reduced exposures to triggers and improved adherence to controller medications. Although it is imperative that control should be maintained and asthma medications be continued in all patients, management of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2 including adjustment of controllers and biologics should be discussed on an individual basis.",2020-10-16,"Assaf, Sara M; Tarasevych, Svitlana P; Diamant, Zuzana; Hanania, Nicola A",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33065601/,223554689.0

The existing literature is limited. Objective(s) To develop a robust, reliable and valid methodology to evaluate distribution and persistence of dental aerosol and splatter, including the evaluation of clinical procedures. Methods Fluorescein was introduced into the irrigation reservoirs of a high-speed air-turbine, ultrasonic scaler and 3-in-1 spray and procedures performed on a mannequin in triplicate. Filter papers were placed in the immediate environment. The impact of dental suction and assistant presence were also evaluated. Samples were analysed using photographic image analysis, and spectrofluorometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Pearson’s correlation for comparison of analytic methods. Results All procedures were aerosol and splatter generating. Contamination was highest closest to the source, remaining high to 1-1.5 m. Contamination was detectable at the maximum distance measured (4 m) for high-speed air-turbine with maximum relative fluorescence units (RFU) being: 46,091 at 0.5 m, 3,541 at 1.0 m, and 1,695 at 4 m. There was uneven spatial distribution with highest levels of contamination opposite the operator. Very low levels of contamination (≤0.1% of original) were detected at 30 and 60 minutes post procedure. Suction reduced contamination by 67-75% at 0.5-1.5 m. Mannequin and operator were heavily contaminated. The two analytic methods showed good correlation (r=0.930, n=244, p<0.001).

Although several methods do exist to monitor these parameters, optimal approaches are still under consideration and technological development. Wrist actigraphy is a non-invasive electro-physical method validated in the field of chronobiology to record movements and to allow for monitoring human activity-rest-cycles. Based on the continuous recording of motor activity and light exposure, actigraphy provides valuable information about the quality and quantity of the sleep–wake rhythm and about the amount of motor activity at day and night that is highly relevant for predicting a potential disease and its targeted prevention as well as personalisation of medical services provided to individuals in suboptimal health conditions and patients. Being generally used in the field of sleep medicine, actigraphy demonstrates a great potential to be successfully implemented in primary, secondary and tertiary care, psychiatry, oncology, and intensive care, military and sports medicines as well as epidemiological monitoring of behavioural habits as well as well-being medical support, amongst others. PREDICTION OF DISEASE DEVELOPMENT AND INDIVIDUAL OUTCOMES: Activity-rest-cycles have been demonstrated to be an important predictor for many diseases including but not restricted to the development of metabolic, psychiatric and malignant pathologies. Moreover, activity-rest-cycles directly impact individual outcomes in corresponding patient cohorts. TARGETED PREVENTION: Data acquired by actigraphy are instrumental for the evidence-based targeted prevention by analysing individualised patient profiles including light exposure, sleep duration and quality, activity-rest-cycles, intensity and structure of motion pattern. PERSONALISED THERAPY: Wrist actigraphic approach is increasingly used in clinical care. Personalised measurements of sedation/agitation rhythms are useful for ICU patients, for evaluation of motor fatigue in oncologic patients, for an individual enhancement of performance in military and sport medicine. In the framework of personalised therapy intervention, patients can be encouraged to optimise their behavioural habits improving recovery and activity patterns. This opens excellent perspectives for the sleep-inducing medication and stimulants replacement as well as for increasing the role of participatory medicine by visualising and encouraging optimal behavioural patterns of the individual.",2021-08-06,"Acker, Jens; Golubnitschaja, Olga; Büttner-Teleaga, Antje; Richter, Kneginja",EPMA J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ea220939207dffa75429641280660b76953957c5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8342270.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377218/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-021-00250-5,236944210.0

zlaa991d,,WHO,Development of early warning and rapid response system for patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19): A research protocol,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused serious damage to public health. COVID-19 has no vaccine or specific therapy; its mortality rate increases significantly once patients deteriorate. Furthermore, intensive monitoring of COVID-19 is limited by insufficient medical resources and increased risks of exposure to medical staff. We therefore aim to build an early warning and rapid response system (EWRRS) to address these problems. METHOD: The research is designed as a prospective cohort study, to verify a dynamic and interactive evaluation system; it includes patient self-reporting, active monitoring, early alarming and treatment recommendations. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be recruited from Sept 2020 to Aug 2021 at a tertiary contagious hospital. Patients with life expectancy <48âhours, pregnant or lactating, in immunosuppression states or end-stage diseases will be excluded. The intervention is implementation of EWRRS to detect early signs of clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients, to provide timely and efficient treatment suggestions by the system. EWRRS can determine the classification and interactive evaluation of patient information; the determination is based on the application of 3 different scenario modules, separately driven by patients, nurses, and physicians. The primary outcome is change in disease severity category after treatment. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with different disease severity types; critical deterioration events; patients who had unplanned transfers to an intensive care unit (ICU) and required critical care interventions; intervals from warning to implementation of clinical interventions; hospital mortality; length of ICU and hospital stay; workload of medical staff and risks of exposure to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Our hypothesis is that EWRRS provides an example of an early identification, warning, and response system for COVID-19. In addition, EWRRS can potentially be extended to use as a grading metric for general critically ill patients in an ICU setting.",2020,"Zhou, Hua; Huang, Huibin; Xie, Xiaolei; Gao, Jiandong; Wu, Ji; Zhu, Yan; He, Wei; Liu, Jingyuan; Li, Ang; Xu, Yuan",Medicine (Baltimore),,#733315,,,,,221343622.0

w8l5o73y,,WHO,What the dental practitioner needs to know about pharmaco-therapeutic modalities of COVID-19 treatment: A review,,,,unk,"Background: /purpose: Several pharmacotherapeutic methods have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 with varying degrees of success. No definitive treatment or vaccine has been officially approved to-date. This review aimed to highlight COVID-19 pharmacotherapeutic agents that are relevant to dental practice in terms of their clinical indications in COVID-19 and dental practice, as well as their adverse effects as they impact the dental patient. Material and methods: Systematic search was performed using the following keywords combinations: Pharmacotherapy AND COVID-19 OR Pharmacotherapy AND SARS-CoV-2 OR Treatment AND COVID-19. Studies were categorized according to the type of pharmacotherapy used. Pharmacotherapeutic agents were extracted and only those relevant to dental practice were included for review. Results: For analysis, a total of 79 clinical trials research articles were included that included COVID-19 pharmacotherapeutic agents relevant to dental practice. Those were analgesics (paracetamol; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents); antibiotics (azithromycin, doxycycline, metronidazole); antivirals (penciclovir); and immunomodulatory agents (hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids). While some COVID-19 drugs are less relevant to dental practice, as antivirals and hydroxychloroquine, their association with long-term adverse effects requires adequate knowledge among dental practitioners. Conclusion: Many of COVID-19 pharmacotherapeutic agents are used to treat oral diseases particularly orofacial pain and inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, some of these drugs may induce adverse effects that complicate dental treatment.

ccodi48c,,WHO,Evaluation of potential anti-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) drugs against the newly emerged model of COVID-19 RdRP using computational methods,,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: Despite all the efforts to treat COVID-19, no particular cure has been found for this virus. Since developing antiviral drugs is a time-consuming process, the most effective approach is to evaluate the approved and under investigation drugs using in silico methods. Among the different targets within the virus structure, as a vital component in the life cycle of coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) can be a critical target for antiviral drugs. The impact of the existence of RNA in the enzyme structure on the binding affinity of anti-RdRP drugs has not been investigated so far. METHODS: In this study, the potential anti-RdRP effects of a variety of drugs from two databases (Zinc database and DrugBank) were evaluated using molecular docking. For this purpose, the newly emerged model of COVID-19 (RdRP) post-translocated catalytic complex (PDB ID: 7BZF) that consists of RNA was chosen as the target. RESULTS: The results indicated that idarubicin (IDR), a member of the anthracycline antibiotic family, and fenoterol (FNT), a known beta-2 adrenergic agonist drug, tightly bind to the target enzyme and could be used as potential anti-RdRP inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These outcomes revealed that due to the ligand-protein interactions, the presence of RNA in this structure could remarkably affect the binding affinity of inhibitor compounds. CONCLUSION: In silico approaches, such as molecular docking, could effectively address the problem of finding appropriate treatment for COVID-19. Our results showed that IDR and FNT have a significant affinity to the RdRP of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, these drugs are remarkable inhibitors of coronaviruses.",2021,"Poustforoosh, Alireza; Hashemipour, Hassan; Tüzün, Burak; Pardakhty, Abbas; Mehrabani, Mehrnaz; Nematollahi, Mohammad Hadi",Biophys Chem,,#1091923,,,,,231965781.0

It has been widely analyzed from legal, sociological, and clinical perspectives, but not equally so from the bioethical point of view. This article sets out to take a more in-depth look at the experiences of midwives in order to describe the ethical perspectives of obstetric violence. We intend to describe the effects that malpractice and violence within obstetric care have on American and European bioethical principles. Methodology: A qualitative methodology of the phenomenological tradition was used: 24 midwives participated in three focus groups. Results and Discussion: four categories were arrived at; they are “the maleficence of forgetting my vulnerability”, “beneficence requires respect for my integrity and dignity”, “my autonomy is being removed from me” and “a problem of social justice towards us, women”. Conclusion: obstetric violence infringes on the main bioethical principles (non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy, justice, vulnerability, dignity, and integrity). Beyond whether it is called violence or not, what matters from an ethical perspective is that, as long as women have such negative experiences during pregnancy and childbirth, obstetric care needs better humanizing.",2021-11-29,"Martín-Badia, Júlia; Obregón-Gutiérrez, Noemí; Goberna-Tricas, Josefina",Int J Environ Res Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2cca597a010508c5dd423d533978b6316e2484a1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8656655.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8656655/,

Mortality is higher in men than in women, because men age faster, and it is especially high in patients with age-related diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, because these diseases are manifestations of aging and a measure of biological age. At its deepest level, aging (a program-like continuation of developmental growth) is driven by inappropriately high cellular functioning. The hyperfunction theory of quasi-programmed aging explains why COVID-19 vulnerability (lethality) is an age-dependent syndrome, linking it to other age-related diseases. It also explains inflammaging and immunosenescence, hyperinflammation, hyperthrombosis, and cytokine storms, all of which are associated with COVID-19 vulnerability.

Plasma C5a and C3a levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: We identified elevated levels of plasma C3a and C5a in HD patients with severe COVID-19 compared with controls. Serial sampling identified that C5a levels were elevated prior to clinical deterioration in patients who developed severe disease. C3a more closely mirrored both clinical and biochemical disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that activation of complement plays a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, leading to endothelial injury and lung damage.

This effect of the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D), can be attributed to its potential to modulate proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis and is supported by many in vitro and animal studies, but its exact mechanism is poorly known. In a fraction of TNBCs that harbor mutations that cause the loss of function of the DNA repair-associated breast cancer type 1 susceptibility (BRCA1) gene, 1,25(OH)2D may induce protective effects by activating its receptor and inactivating cathepsin L-mediated degradation of tumor protein P53 binding protein 1 (TP53BP1), preventing deficiency in DNA double-strand break repair and contributing to genome stability. Similar effects can be induced by the interaction of 1,25(OH)2D with proteins of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 (GADD45) family.

These flies have undergone a variety of specializations during their evolution including an exclusive diet consisting solely of vertebrate blood for both sexes as well as an obligate viviparous reproductive biology. Alongside these adaptations, Glossina species have developed intricate relationships with specific microbes ranging from mutualistic to parasitic. These relationships provide fundamental support required to sustain the specializations associated with tsetse's biology. This chapter provides an overview on the knowledge to date regarding the biology behind these relationships and focuses primarily on four bacterial species that are consistently associated with Glossina species. Here their interactions with the host are reviewed at the morphological, biochemical and genetic levels. This includes: the obligate symbiont Wigglesworthia, which is found in all tsetse species and is essential for nutritional supplementation to the blood-specific diet, immune system maturation and facilitation of viviparous reproduction; the commensal symbiont Sodalis, which is a frequently associated symbiont optimized for survival within the fly via nutritional adaptation, vertical transmission through mating and may alter vectorial capacity of Glossina for trypanosomes; the parasitic symbiont Wolbachia, which can manipulate Glossina via cytoplasmic incompatibility and shows unique interactions at the genetic level via horizontal transmission of its genetic material into the genome in two Glossina species; finally, knowledge on recently observed relations between Spiroplasma and Glossina is explored and potential interactions are discussed based on knowledge of interactions between this bacterial Genera and other insect species.

We hypothesized that there are metabolic ischemic disturbances measurable noninvasively by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) that occur earlier than any structural changes visible on diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), which may therefore serve for territorial identification of tissue at risk. METHODS We performed multivoxel (1)H MRS plus DTI within a maximum of 26 hours, and DTI at 3-7 days, after ischemic stroke. We compared choline, lactate, N-acetylaspartate, and creatine concentrations in normal-appearing voxels that became infarcted (infarct expansion) with normal-appearing voxels around the infarct that remained ""healthy"" (nonexpansion) on follow-up DTI. Each infarct expansion voxel was additionally classified as either complete infarct expansion (infarcted tissue on follow-up DTI covered > or =50% of the voxel) or partial infarct expansion (<50% of voxel). RESULTS In 31 patients (NIH Stroke Scale score 0-28), there were 108 infarct nonexpansion voxels and 113 infarct expansion voxels (of which 80 were complete expansion and 33 partial expansion voxels). Brain choline concentration increased for each change in expansion category from nonexpansion, via partial expansion to complete expansion (2,423, 3,843, 4,158 IU; p < 0.05). Changes in lactate, N-acetylaspartate, and creatine concentrations in expansion category were insignificant although for lactate there was a tendency to such association. CONCLUSIONS Choline concentration measurable with (1)H MRS was elevated in peri-ischemic normal-appearing brain that became infarcted by 3-7 days. The degree of elevation was associated with the amount of infarct expansion. (1)H MRS might identify DTI-normal-appearing tissue at risk of conversion to infarction in early stroke.",2010,"Karaszewski, B; Thomas, R G R; Chappell, F M; Armitage, P A; Carpenter, T K; Lymer, G K S; Dennis, M S; Marshall, I; Wardlaw, J M",Neurology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0b013e3181f11bf1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20819997/,10926320.0

In the field of hepatology, social determinants of health (SDOH) are closely linked to disparities in liver disease prevalence, outcomes, and access to treatment. The economic disruption and physical distancing policies brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated these disparities, and may have long-lasting health consequences for marginalized patients with chronic liver disease. There are several ways that hepatology providers can bridge the gap in health equity through addressing SDOH, extending from the individual to the community and societal levels. Interventions at the individual level include implementation of systematic screening for social barriers in our hepatology practices to identify gaps in the care cascade. At the community and societal levels, interventions include creating collaborative partnerships with public health workers to expand health care access to the community, increasing funding for research investigating the association of SDOH, health disparities, and liver disease, engaging in advocacy to support policy reform that tackles the upstream social determinants, and addressing racism and implicit bias.

Efforts have been made to reduce the size of the single-dose vaccines; however, with two-dose, five-dose and ten-dose options available, the question then is whether using multi-dose instead of single-dose rotavirus vaccines will improve vaccine availability. METHODS: We used HERMES-generated simulation models of the vaccine supply chains of the Republic of Benin, Mozambique, and Bihar, a state in India, to evaluate the operational and economic impact of implementing each of the nine different rotavirus vaccine presentations. RESULTS: Among single-dose rotavirus vaccines, using Rotarix RV1 MMP (multi-monodose presentation) led to the highest rotavirus vaccine availability (49–80%) and total vaccine availability (56–79%), and decreased total costs per dose administered ($0.02-$0.10) compared to using any other single-dose rotavirus vaccine. Using two-dose ROTASIIL decreased rotavirus vaccine availability by 3–6% across each supply chain compared to Rotarix RV1 MMP, the smallest single-dose vaccine. Using a five-dose rotavirus vaccine improved rotavirus vaccine availability (52–92%) and total vaccine availability (60–85%) compared to single-dose and two-dose vaccines. Further, using the ten-dose vaccine led to the highest rotavirus vaccine availability compared to all other rotavirus vaccines in both Benin and Bihar.

To robustly examine whether increases in digital technology use are associated with increases in psychological distress during the pandemic it is crucial to (1) collect objective data on digital technology use and (2) account for potential confounding caused by pandemic-related stressors. METHODS: We conducted a four-wave panel study of U.S. young adults (N=384; Mage = 24.5 ± 5.1; 57% female) from August-November of 2020. Participants provided screenshots of their iPhone ""Screen Time"" application and completed measures assessing current mental health status (depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation) and pandemic-related impacts on well-being. We used random-intercept multilevel models to examine the within- and between-person associations between mental health, objective digital technology use, and pandemic-related stressors. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses revealed that none of the objectively-measured digital technology use variables were positively associated with depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation at the within- or between-person levels. In contrast, pandemic-related impacts on mental health had by far the largest effects on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. LIMITATIONS: The convenience-based sample and use of single-item measures of pandemic-related impacts are limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Current speculations about the direct harms of digital technology use on mental health may be unfounded and risk diverting attention from a more likely cause: pandemic-related distress.",2021,"Sewall, Craig J R; Goldstein, Tina R; Rosen, Daniel",J Affect Disord,,#1193358,,,,,233389963.0

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey of physician members of Pediatric Emergency Research Canada and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians explored: personal safety/responsibility to care; patient interactions; ethical issues in pandemic care; institutional dynamics and communication practices. Data analysis was descriptive: categorical data were summarised with frequency distributions, continuous data [100 mm visual analog scales (VAS)] were analysed using measures of central tendency. Short open-ended items were coded to identify frequencies of responses. RESULTS: From June 29 to July 29, 2020, 187 respondents (13% response rate) completed the survey: 39% were from Ontario and 20% from Quebec, trained in general (50%) or pediatric (37%) emergency medicine. Respondents reported a high moral obligation to care for patients (97/100, IQR: 85–100, on 100 mm VAS). Fear of contracting COVID-19 changed how 82% of respondents reported interacting with patients, while 97% reported PPE negatively impacted patient care. Despite reporting a high proportion of negative emotions (84%), respondents (59%) were not/slightly concerned about their mental health. Top concerns included a potential second wave, Canada’s financial situation, worldwide solidarity, and youth mental health. Facilitators to provide emergency care included: teamwork, leadership, clear communications strategies. CONCLUSION: Canadian emergency physicians felt a strong sense of responsibility to care, while dealing with several ethical dilemmas. Clear communication strategies, measures to ensure safety, and appropriate emergency department setups facilitate pandemic care.

This fact tends to obscure the reality that most, if not all the global challenges, are closely interdependent and need a holistic approach to deal with them in a coherent and effective way. Likewise, society at large must be made fully aware that there will not be an enduring solution unless there is a change in the level of consumption of goods and energy in affluent countries. There is an increasing perception, understanding and concern in academic circles as well as in other sectors of society that the unsustainable production and consumption of natural resources need to be tackled by novel approaches. These combined efforts should ensure that they will be enacted in policy initiatives and in the actions that pave the way to building a global biodiplomacy.

ABSTRACT The 2019 corona virus disease (COVID-19) which outbreak in December 2019, in the Chinese city of Wuhan has became a global threat and is currently the largest known outbreak of atypical pneumonia affecting every continent of the world with about 6,416,828 cases and 382,867 deaths. Disease enforced lockdowns are known to cause heightened levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic enforced lockdown on mental health and quality of life among general population aged 18 years and to identify various coping strategies used under lockdown. An online survey was conducted between 1st of April - 10th of May, 2020; using a validated questionnaire based on DASS-42, employing a snowball sampling technique. A total of 418 responses from 16 different countries were received. The respondents had a high level of depression and anxiety scores, which were significantly different among genders. Also, participants from developing countries – India and Pakistan had severe depression while as participants from India, Pakistan and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had severe anxiety. We also found that among the various coping strategies, a) watching television for entertainment, b) social networking, c) listening to music, d) sleeping, e) doing mundane house chores like cleaning, washing etc f) eating well, and g) clearing/finishing my piled-up work were ranked among the most utilized coping strategies by all participants. This study identifies the need to provide the free professional and psychological services to help cope with stress during the disease enforced lockdown.",2020-07-28,"Aga, Syed Sameer; Khan, Muhammad Anwar; Nissar, Syed Saniya; Banday, Mujeeb Zafar",Ethics Med Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/509205a6a930d4e93de0482f83852c4559edc4d2.json,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352552520301092?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838000/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100571; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352552520301092,220837099.0

Patients with vulvar cancer are frequently elderly and affected by multiple co-morbidities, thus representing a particularly frail population. OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients scheduled for treatment for active vulvar cancer. METHODS Data on patients with vulvar tumors referred to Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS between February 2020 and July 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swab were considered as positive for SARS-Cov-2. RESULTS One hundred and ninety-one patients with vulvar cancer were evaluated and scheduled for treatment. The median age was 72 years (range 35-94). Seven (3.7%) patients were diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection: three (42.9%) had their treatment delayed, with no apparent consequences, two (28.6%) had their treatment delayed and later abandoned because of clinical worsening due to oncologic disease progression, and two (28.6%) contracted the infection in the post-operative period and died due to respiratory complications.

Our objective was to model the cost-per-HIV infection averted by CVCT in six African countries guided by an HIV prevention cascade framework. The HIV prevention cascade as yet to be applied to evaluating CVCT effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. METHODS We defined a priority population for CVCT in Africa as heterosexual adults in stable couples. Based on our previous experience nationalizing CVCT in Rwanda and scaling-up CVCT in 73 clinics in Zambia, we estimated HIV prevention cascade domains of motivation for use, access and effectiveness of CVCT as model parameters. Costs-per-couple tested were also estimated based on our previous studies. We used these parameters as well as country-specific inputs to model the impact of CVCT over a five-year time horizon in a previously developed and tested deterministic compartmental model. We consider six countries across Africa with varied HIV epidemics (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Tanzania, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone). Outcomes of interest were the proportion of HIV infections averted by CVCT, nationwide CVCT implementation costs and costs-per-HIV infection averted by CVCT. We applied 3%/year discounting to costs and outcomes. Univariate and Monte Carlo multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS We estimated that CVCT could avert between 54% (Sierra Leone) and 62% (South Africa) of adult HIV infections. Average costs-per-HIV infection averted were lowest in Zimbabwe ($550) and highest in South Africa ($1272). Nationwide implementations would cost between 7% (Kenya) and 21% (Ivory Coast) of a country's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) budget over five years. In sensitivity analyses, model outputs were most sensitive to estimates of cost-per-couple tested; the proportion of adults in heterosexual couples and HIV prevention cascade domains of CVCT motivation and access. CONCLUSIONS Our model indicates that nationalized CVCT could prevent over half of adult HIV infections for 7% to 21% of the modelled countries' five-year PEPFAR budgets. While other studies have indicated that CVCT motivation is high given locally relevant promotional and educational efforts, without required indicators, targets and dedicated budgets, access remains low.",2020-06-01,"Wall, Kristin M; Inambao, Mubiana; Kilembe, William; Karita, Etienne; Chomba, Elwyn; Vwalika, Bellington; Mulenga, Joseph; Parker, Rachel; Sharkey, Tyronza; Tichacek, Amanda; Hunter, Eric; Yohnka, Robert; Streeb, Gordon; Corso, Phaedra S; Allen, Susan",Journal of the International AIDS Society,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602618/,220268209.0

While in the past, programming skills were much more related to fields of computer sciences and engineering, today, professionals from different areas benefit from the ability to write codes for different applications. Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking, which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their programs. We concluded that an outreach course dedicated to programming promoted improvements in programming skills in health science students.

Entry of LASV into the host cell is mediated by the glycoprotein complex (GPC), which is the only protein located on the viral surface and comprises three subunits: glycoprotein 1 (GP1), glycoprotein 2 (GP2), and a stable signal peptide (SSP). The LASV GPC is a class one viral fusion protein, akin to those found in viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, Ebola virus (EBOV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These viruses are enveloped and utilize membrane fusion to deliver their genetic material to the host cell. Like other class one fusion proteins, LASV-mediated membrane fusion occurs through an orchestrated sequence of conformational changes in its GPC. The receptor-binding subunit, GP1, first engages with a host cell receptor then undergoes a unique receptor switch upon delivery to the late endosome. The acidic pH and change in receptor result in the dissociation of GP1, exposing the fusion subunit, GP2, such that fusion can occur. These events ultimately lead to the formation of a fusion pore so that the LASV genetic material is released into the host cell. Interestingly, the mature GPC retains its SSP as a third subunit—a feature that is unique to arenaviruses. Additionally, the fusion domain contains two separate fusion peptides, instead of a standard singular fusion peptide. Here, we give a comprehensive review of the LASV GPC components and their unusual features.",2022-02-14,"Pennington, Hallie N.; Lee, Jinwoo",Biosci Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2d943bd8c349f086906f9d855fcc1beb47627363.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8844875.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20211930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35088070/,246360590.0

We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the scientific production of non-COVID-19 research. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive meta-research on studies (original articles, research letters and case reports) published between 01/01/2019 and 01/01/2021 in 10 high-impact medical and infectious disease journals (New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association, Nature Medicine, British Medical Journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, Lancet Global Health, Lancet Public Health, Lancet Infectious Disease and Clinical Infectious Disease). For each publication, we recorded publication date, publication type, number of authors, whether the publication was related to COVID-19, whether the publication was based on a case series, and the number of patients included in the study if the publication was based on a case report or a case series. We estimated the publication dynamics with a locally estimated scatterplot smoothing method. A Natural Language Processing algorithm was designed to calculate the number of authors for each publication. We simulated the number of non-COVID-19 studies that could have been published during the pandemic by extrapolating the publication dynamics of 2019 to 2020, and comparing the expected number to the observed number of studies. RESULTS: Among the 22,525 studies assessed, 6319 met the inclusion criteria, of which 1022 (16.2%) were related to COVID-19 research. A dramatic increase in the number of publications in general journals was observed from February to April 2020 from a weekly median number of publications of 4.0 (IQR: 2.8–5.5) to 19.5 (IQR: 15.8–24.8) (p < 0.001), followed afterwards by a pattern of stability with a weekly median number of publications of 10.0 (IQR: 6.0–14.0) until December 2020 (p = 0.045 in comparison with April). Two prototypical editorial strategies were found: 1) journals that maintained the volume of non-COVID-19 publications while integrating COVID-19 research and thus increased their overall scientific production, and 2) journals that decreased the volume of non-COVID-19 publications while integrating COVID-19 publications. We estimated using simulation models that the COVID pandemic was associated with a 18% decrease in the production of non-COVID-19 research. We also found a significant change of the publication type in COVID-19 research as compared with non-COVID-19 research illustrated by a decrease in the number of original articles, (47.9% in COVID-19 publications vs 71.3% in non-COVID-19 publications, p < 0.001). Last, COVID-19 publications showed a higher number of authors, especially for case reports with a median of 9.0 authors (IQR: 6.0–13.0) in COVID-19 publications, compared to a median of 4.0 authors (IQR: 3.0–6.0) in non-COVID-19 publications (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this meta-research gathering publications from high-impact medical journals, we have shown that the dramatic rise in COVID-19 publications was accompanied by a substantial decrease of non-COVID-19 research.

The paper examines the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian stock and commodity markets during the different phases of lockdown. In addition, the effect of COVID-19 on the Indian stock and commodity markets during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 spread was compared. A comparative analysis of the stock market performances and sustainability of selected South Asian countries is also included in the study, which covers the lockdown period as well as the time frame of the first and second waves of COVID-19 spread. To examine the above relationship, the conventional Welch test, heteroskedastic independent t-test, and the GMM multivariate analysis is employed, on the stock return, gold prices, and oil prices. The findings conclude that during the different phases of lockdown in India, COVID-19 has a negative and significant impact on oil prices and stock market performance. However, in terms of gold prices, the effect is positive and significant. The results of the first wave of COVID-19 infection also corroborate with the above findings. However, the results are contradictory during the second wave of coronavirus infection. Furthermore, the study also substantiates that COVID-19 has significantly affected the stock market performances of selected South Asian countries. However, the impact on the stock market performances was only for a short period and it diminished in the second wave of COVID-19 spread in all the selected South Asian countries. The findings contribute to the research on the stock and commodity market impact of a pandemic by providing empirical evidence that COVID-19 has spill-over effects on stock markets and commodity market performances.

sbmqiwi8,,WHO,Genetic Variation and Hybridization in Evolutionary Radiations of Cichlid Fishes,,,,unk,"Evolutionary radiations are responsible for much of the variation in biodiversity. Cichlid fishes are well known for spectacular evolutionary radiations, as they have repeatedly evolved into large and phenotypically diverse arrays of species. Cichlid genomes carry signatures of past events and, at the same time, are the substrate for ongoing evolution. We survey genome-wide data and the available literature covering 438 cichlid populations (412 species) across multiple radiations to synthesize information about patterns and sharing of genetic variation. Nucleotide diversity within species is low in cichlids, with 92% of surveyed populations having less diversity than the median value found in other vertebrates. Divergence within radiations is also low, and a large proportion of variation is shared among species due to incomplete lineage sorting and widespread hybridization. Population genetics therefore provides a suitable conceptual framework for evolutionary genomic studies of cichlid radiations. We focus in detail on the roles of hybridization in shaping the patterns of genetic variation and in promoting cichlid diversification.

Although complete vaccination consisted of two-doses, the onset of protection for both licensed RNA vaccines was observed as early as 12 days after a single dose. The adaptive immune response that coincides with this onset of protection could represent the necessary elements of immunity against Covid-19. Methods: Serological and T cell analysis was performed in a cohort of 20 healthcare workers after receiving the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. The primary endpoint was the adaptive immune responses detectable at Days 7 and 10 after dosing. Results: Spike-specific T cells and binding antibodies were detectable 10 days after the first dose of vaccine, in contrast to receptor-blocking and SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies which were mostly undetectable at this early time-point.

The aim of this study is to check the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) after receiving a single dose of intravenous dexamethasone before docetaxel administration. METHOD In this retrospective study, 1 year data from Jan 1st 2018 to Dec 31st 2018 was retrieved from hospital information system (HIS). We examined 210 patients who visited hospital during the last 12 months during their cancer treatment and took dexamethasone orally 3 days prior to docetaxel administration or 20 mg intravenously before 15 minutes of docetaxel. RESULTS Out of 210 patients, only 50 patients were taking IV dexamethasone injection prior to docetaxel constitutes only 23.5% while patients who were taking oral dexamethasone were found to be 160 which constitutes 75%. There was no hypersensitivity reaction with oral and IV dexamethasone before docetaxel administration. Majority of the patients were without taking oral dexamethasone before docetaxel administration which not only saved time but also improve patient compliance. CONCLUSION No hypersensitivity reaction had been found either in oral or intravenous dexamethasone prior to docetaxel administration by using patient data from Hospital Information System (HIS).

Young adults, and in particular, those residing in deprived areas are currently the loneliest group in the United Kingdom. Utilizing a novel‐free association technique, young adults’ experiences of loneliness were explored both prior to (n = 48) and during (n = 35) the COVID‐19 pandemic. Drawing on social representations theory, a thematic analysis revealed that many young adults associated the experience of loneliness with their homes. Therefore, this comparative study aims to investigate how the home features in young adults’ representations of loneliness, prior to and during the COVID‐19 pandemic using a systematic qualitative methodology. Three salient themes emerged from the data in both periods: ‘The Lonely Home,’ ‘The Socially Connected Home’ and ‘The Safe, Peaceful, Authentic Home’. ‘The Lonely Home’ and ‘The Socially Connected Home’ emerged as a dialogical antimony. Representations of home were similar across the two periods; however, there were some notable differences. In particular, the themes ‘The Socially Connected Home’ and ‘The Safe, Peaceful, Authentic Home’ were less frequently mentioned by the during‐COVID‐19 sample where the ‘The Lonely Home’ was more frequently mentioned by the during‐COVID‐19 sample. Overall, discussion of the home was more negatively valenced in the during‐COVID‐19 sample compared to the pre‐COVID‐19 sample.

But, as federal, state and local governments begin opening businesses and relaxing shelter-in-place orders worldwide, we lack quantitative evidence on how policies in one region affect mobility and social distancing in other regions and the consequences of uncoordinated regional policies adopted in the presence of such spillovers. To investigate this concern, we combined daily, county-level data on shelter-in-place policies with movement data from over 27 million mobile devices, social network connections among over 220 million Facebook users, daily temperature and precipitation data from 62,000 weather stations, and county-level census data on population demographics to estimate the geographic and social network spillovers created by regional policies across the United States. Our analysis shows that the contact patterns of people in a given region are significantly influenced by the policies and behaviors of people in other, sometimes distant, regions. When just one-third of a state's social and geographic peer states adopt shelter-in-place policies, it creates a reduction in mobility equal to the state's own policy decisions. These spillovers are mediated by peer travel and distancing behaviors in those states. A simple analytical model calibrated with our empirical estimates demonstrated that the ""loss from anarchy"" in uncoordinated state policies is increasing in the number of noncooperating states and the size of social and geographic spillovers.

Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers enhance the expression of ACE2, the binding receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and can enhance viral infectivity. We aim to provide a pooled estimate of the effect of RAAS blockers on COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar and preprint servers. All clinical studies analyzing the effect of RAAS blockers on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used for quality assessment of studies. MOOSE checklist was followed. Mortality and severity outcomes were recorded as pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and level of heterogeneity (I(2)). Odds of mortality was the primary outcome. Odds of severity, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (MV), steroid use and acute kidney injury were the secondary outcomes. Severity outcomes were chosen depending upon the definition used by respective authors. Country-specific variations and effects of individual class of RAAS blockers were also explored. RESULTS: In total 47 published studies were included in the final analysis, with a total of 26,432 patients from 31 studies in mortality analysis and 20,127 patients from 23 studies in severity analysis. No increased risk of mortality [Pooled OR 0.91 (0.65–1.26), I(2) = 89%] or severity [Pooled OR 1.08 (0.79–1.46), I(2) = 88%] was seen with RAAS blockers. The drug class was protective in hypertension [pooled OR 0.63 (0.46–0.86), I(2) = 58%]. Severity of COVID-19 outcomes was high for Europeans [Pooled OR 2.08 (1.52–2.85), I(2) = 77%] and US patients [Pooled OR 1.87 (1.62–2.17)]. Nearly 4 times higher risk of hospitalization and 2 times higher risk of ICU admission and MV were observed in US patients. Class-wise, angiotensin receptor blocker use was associated with 1.6 times higher odds of severity, mainly in Europeans. CONCLUSION: RAAS blockers are not associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients and should be continued in hypertensives. US and European patients are at higher risk of severe outcomes. Pharmacogenetic differences may explain the ethnicity-related variations. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Effect of RAAS-blocking medicines on COVID-19 Background and aims: Higher deaths have been observed in COVID-19 patients who have other long-term diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Many of these patients are prescribed a class of medicines called RAAS blockers (ramipril, telmisartan, etc). We studied whether the use of these medicines worsens the course of COVID-19 disease in these patients or causes excess deaths. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of 47 observational studies on the use of RAAS blocker drugs in COVID-19 patients. Results: We found that RAAS blockers do not cause excess deaths in patients with COVID-19. On the contrary, they have benefits if prescribed to those with high blood pressure. We also found that whereas European and US patients of COVID-19 taking these medicines had higher disease severity, this was not the case for Chinese patients.

Senior nursing students saw the elimination of in-person clinical opportunities in the final months prior to graduation as health care facilities restricted access to essential personnel in an effort to minimize transmission of the virus and conserve personal protective equipment. METHOD To fulfill course requirements, faculty created a COVID-19 assignment that implored students to research the most current infection control recommendations for COVID-19 and to describe the impacts of the virus on nursing care, patients, families, interdisciplinary collaboration, and public safety. RESULTS The COVID-19 assignment fostered clinical reasoning and encouraged personal reflection with application to practice. Students reported that the assignment greatly enhanced knowledge and awareness of COVID-19. CONCLUSION This assignment was beneficial for transition to practice in the midst of a pandemic, and it can be easily replicated for any future emerging health care topic that may affect nursing education.

The optimal method for histological assessment of response and the effect of NAET on the tumour morphology, grade and molecular profile remain unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS A single large institution cohort of 132 patients who received NAET over a 13-year period was identified. Comprehensive clinical, histopathological and follow up data were collected. A detailed histological review of a subset with residual post-treatment carcinoma was undertaken. RESULTS Two carcinomas (both of lobular type) achieved complete pathological response. Central scarring was seen in 49.3% of tumours post-treatment. Significant changes in tumour type (41.6%), grade (downgrading in a third of tumours), PR expression (22.3%) with a switch to PR negative status in 17.6% of cases were observed. The latter was associated with absence of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (p=0.005). 10% of cases showed a change in HER2 expression (p=0.002).

A Survey to Evaluate Hospital Workers' Opinion,,,,unk,"Prospective planning of COVID-19 vaccines allocation will be essential to maximize public health and societal benefits while preserving equity. Decisions about how to allocate limited supplies of vaccines need to be clear about the criteria used in setting priorities, with a specific commitment to transparency and communication. The aim of our study was to think through these competing demands, focusing on the opinion of healthcare workers (HCWs). The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the opinion of all the HCWs in a University based Italian Hospital about the fairest priority order to COVID 19 vaccines and to understand on which criteria the prioritization preferences of HCWs are implicitly based. The secondary endpoints were to assess whether HCWs approach differs from national guidelines and to assess the attitude of HCWs towards mandatory vaccination. An online survey accounting with multiple choice single answer questions and ranking questions was administered to all the HCWs of the University Hospital P. Giaccone of Palermo (Italy) and completed by a total of 465 participants. Almost all respondents confirmed the need for prioritization in COVID-19 vaccination for HCWs (n = 444; 95.5%), essential services and law enforcement (both n = 428; 92%). Clinically vulnerable individuals, HCWs and population over 65 years have been considered the first three groups to be involved in getting vaccination, being indicated as first position group by 26.5%, 32.5% and 21.9% of respondents, respectively. A large majority of respondents (85%) asked for a consistent, transparent and detailed order of priority at a national level. After adjusting for potential confounding due to sex and age, physicians have been found to be statistically significantly associated with the choice of mandatory vaccination (odds ratio (OR): 10.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.7-39.1) or with other strategies different from voluntary (OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 1.9-27.3). The broad consensus expressed by respondents towards mandatory vaccination for HCWs is extremely relevant at a time when vaccination hesitation is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving herd immunity. Data show a mismatch in the position attributed to long-term care residents compared to the position of absolute priority assigned by most of national distribution plans, impelling us to reflect on the issue of maximizing benefit from limited healthcare resources. Our findings clearly indicate a preference for COVID-19 frontline health professionals as the first tier of recipients, since they better meet all the criteria (higher risk, immediate system stability). As the guidelines are likely to directly affect a considerable number of citizens, our results call for policy interventions to inform people on the ethical rationale behind vaccine distribution decisions, to avoid resentment and feelings of unfairness.",2021,"Craxì, Lucia; Casuccio, Alessandra; Amodio, Emanuele; Restivo, Vincenzo",,,#1122497,,,,,232129278.0

On one hand, the pandemic is occurring at a time when forests are already under unprecedented pressures from climate change, amplifying concerns about unsustainable forest extraction in the name of economic recovery. On the other hand, however, the crisis has helped to gather momentum around the notion of a “green recovery,” including setting aside additional land for forest conservation. Drawing insights from past and ongoing research in India, we highlight an issue that exemplifies the tension between these two poles: the role of forests as social safety nets for rural communities in developing countries. It is well established that forests can provide critical resources for rural livelihoods, especially in times of crisis, and preliminary reports suggest that these resources have become even more important in the context of India's COVID lockdowns, and mass return migration from urban to rural areas. As the second wave of the pandemic continues to unfold in India, we highlight some key research priorities, including: 1) understanding how and to what extent forest-dependent communities and industries are changing their use of wood- and non-wood resources in the context of return migration and economic stress;2) tracking shifts in forest cover, structure, and composition that may result from increased extractive pressures;3) assessing the role of institutions, whether local, national, or international, in mediating these outcomes. Drawing on these observations, we suggest some key principles for integrating forest-based livelihoods into “green recovery,” founded on principles that articulate forests as complex and integrated social-ecological systems, prioritize equity, and build on past learnings of community-based forest management.",2021,"Saxena, Alark Dutta Anwesha Fischer Harry W.; Keleman Saxena, Alder Jantz Patrick",Forest Policy and Economics,,#covidwho-1293790,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2021.102550,237660336.0

Our objective was to survey rhinologists and understand the extent to which telemedicine serves as a rejoinder to in-person consultation: appreciation of relevant factors may be important in planning for present and future considerations. METHODS: A 14-question anonymous survey sent out to the American Rhinologic Society (ARS) membership in April 2020. It included demographic factors and detailed questions examining the extent of telemedicine use. Numerous topics including the degree of use, satisfaction with services, and utility of services were evaluated. RESULTS: There were 134 respondents. Most reported seeing ≤30% of typical in-person volume, with 14.8% not seeing any patients at all. 88.1% used telemedicine; 82.0% reported some level of satisfaction with telemedicine. The vast majority utilized platforms employing audio and video (83.3%), and a plurality reported spending 5–15 min on calls. Numerous reasons were cited for the use of telemedicine, including significant public health benefits amid the crisis (89.7%). Only 12.0% of respondents reported using telemedicine for hospital consultation. CONCLUSION: Rhinologists have embraced telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic in an attempt to improve accessibility, patient satisfaction, and revenue stream.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are vulnerable due to their role in the management of COVID-19 infected patients. As of June 2020, a total of 847 HCWs in Oman had reportedly contracted COVID-19, with an incidence rate of 1.47%. This study therefore aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 infection among HCWs in Muscat Governorate, Oman, as well as to evaluate adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection among HCWs working under the Directorate General of Health Services of Muscat Governorate, Ministry of Health, between February and June 2020. Data regarding the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics, risk factors, pre-existing medical conditions, and adherence to IPC measures were collected using a self-administered questionnaire distributed via a web-based mobile application. RESULTS: A total of 126 HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 infection participated in the study. Of these, 72.2% were female, 53.2% worked in primary care facilities, and 61.1% were medical doctors or nurses. Only 18.1% were over 45 years of age and 30.2% had pre-existing medical conditions. While 29.4% had never received IPC training, the majority followed recommended hand hygiene practice (96.8%) and social distancing protocols (93.7%) and wore protective facemasks for routine patient care (96.9%). CONCLUSION: While the majority of HCWs followed crucial IPC measures, one-third had never received specific IPC training or faced restrictions on PPE use. HCWs, including those in housekeeping and administrative functions are recommended to undergo rigorous IPC training. In addition, high-risk HCWs could be assigned duties away from active COVID 19 cases.

As the world is heading towards the fourth industrial revolution, the implicit utilization of artificial-intelligence-enabled semantic web technologies paves the way for many real-time application developments. The fundamental building blocks for the overwhelming utilization of semantic web technologies are ontologies, and it allows sharing as well as reusing the concepts in a standardized way so that the data gathered from heterogeneous sources receive a common nomenclature, and it paves the way for disambiguating the duplicates very easily. In this context, the right utilization of ontology capabilities would further strengthen its presence in many web-based applications such as e-learning, virtual communities, social media sites, healthcare, agriculture, etc. In this paper, we have given the comprehensive review of using the semantic web in the domain of healthcare, some virtual communities, and other information retrieval projects. As the role of semantic web is becoming pervasive in many domains, the demand for the semantic web in healthcare, virtual communities, and information retrieval has been gaining huge momentum in recent years. To obtain the correct sense of the meaning of the words or terms given in the textual content, it is deemed necessary to apply the right ontology to fix the ambiguity and shun any deviations that persist on the concepts.

Special emphasis has been given to discuss guidelines for handling different prosthodontic procedures and implications of this pandemic on prosthodontic practice, education and research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant literature pertaining to COVID-19 and dentistry was scrutinized on electronic search engines including PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane. Guidelines given by various organizations, institutions, national and international regulatory bodies and Indian Prosthodontic Society were also consulted to gather information pertaining to the objectives of our review. RESULTS: and observations: A total of 160 articles including cross-sectional studies, in vitro study, narrative reviews, letters to the editor and opinions were found to be relevant in accordance with our search strategy. Documented literature revealed that Covid-19 pandemic has culminated in serious clinical, financial and psychological implications in the field of dentistry. Certain steps such as adoption of teledentistry, judicious use of protective equipment, use of rubber dams, pre-procedural rinses have been suggested unanimously. However, there is a dearth of evidence-based recommendations in literature. Data regarding consequences of delaying prosthodontic procedures and patients’ perspectives is also sparse.

We hypothesized that the sensitivity of D‐dimer for PE at current institutional cut points would be similar to those without COVID‐19. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective observational cohort study across five urban and suburban EDs in the same health care system. The electronic health record was queried for all computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) studies from December 1, 2019, to October 22, 2020. All ED patients who underwent CTPA had D‐dimer and COVID‐19 testing completed in a single encounter were included in the study. Baseline demographics were obtained. Test characteristics of D‐dimer for PE were calculated for patients with and without COVID‐19. Additionally, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed for two different D‐dimer assays. RESULTS: There were 1158 patient encounters that met criteria for analysis. Performance of D‐dimer testing for PE was similar between COVID‐19–positive and –negative patients. In COVID‐19–positive patients, the sensitivity was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 87.6%–100%), specificity was 11.9% (95% CI = 7.9%–17.1%), and negative predictive value (NPV) was 100%. In COVID‐19–negative patients the sensitivity was 97.6% (95% CI = 91.5%–99.7%), specificity was 14.4% (95% CI = 12.1%–17%), and NPV was 98.3% (95% CI = 93.8%–99.6%). For assay 1 the area under the curve (AUC) for COVID‐19–positive patients was 0.76 (95% CI = 0.68–0.83), and for COVID‐19–negative patients, 0.73 (95% CI = 0.69–0.77). For assay 2, AUC for COVID‐19–positive patients was 0.85 (95% CI = 0.77–0.92), and for COVID‐19–negative patients, 0.80 (95% CI = 0.77–0.84). Inspection of the ROC curve for assay 1 revealed that 100% sensitivity was maintained up to a threshold of 0.67 FEU (fibrinogen equivalent units; from 0.50 FEU) with an increase in specificity to 29% (from 18.7%), and for assay 2, 100% sensitivity was maintained up to a threshold of 662 D‐dimer units (DDU; from 230 DDU) with an increased specificity to 59% (from 6.1%). CONCLUSION: Results from this multicenter retrospective study did not find a significant difference in sensitivity of D‐dimer for PE due to concomitant COVID‐19 infection.

Almost 20years ago, an essay by Sitia and Meldolesi first listed what was known at the time about domain formation within the ER. In the time that has passed since, additional ER domains have been discovered and characterized. These include the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), the ER quality control compartment (ERQC), where ER-associated degradation (ERAD) occurs, and the plasma membrane-associated membrane (PAM). Insight has been gained into the separation of nuclear envelope proteins from the remainder of the ER. Research has also shown that the biogenesis of peroxisomes and lipid droplets occurs on specialized membranes of the ER. Several studies have shown the existence of specific marker proteins found on all these domains and how they are targeted there. Moreover, a first set of cytosolic ER-associated sorting proteins, including phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS-2) and Rab32 have been identified. Intra-ER targeting mechanisms appear to be superimposed onto ER retention mechanisms and rely on transmembrane and cytosolic sequences. The crucial roles of ER domain formation for cell physiology are highlighted with the specific targeting of the tumor metastasis regulator gp78 to ERAD-mediating membranes or of the promyelocytic leukemia protein to the MAM.",2011-10-31,"Lynes, Emily M.; Simmen, Thomas",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/86d4262de73cf81b5ea6aafb91630853248bff5f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172674.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21756943/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.06.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488911001765; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167488911001765,36821476.0

Central to pyroptosis induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Inflammasome formation, and by extension pyroptosis, may be inhibited by certain anti-inflammatory drugs. One such drug, tranilast, is currently being evaluated as a COVID-19 treatment target in a clinical trial. In this study, we present a single-cell mathematical model that captures the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, pyroptotic cell death and drug-responses to tranilast. The model is formulated in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the dynamics of proteins involved in pyroptosis. The model demonstrates that tranilast delays the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus may alter the mode of cell death from inflammatory (pyroptosis) to non-inflammatory (e.g., apoptosis).",2020-08-10,"Hamis, Sara J; Macfarlane, Fiona R",,,,2008.04172,document_parses/pdf_json/8beaeca90fb0370d3698980abadc5665dc312aa5.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04172v1.pdf,221090105.0

Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) spike protein at 3.3-Å resolution. The trimeric protein contains three receptor-binding S1 subunits that tightly pack into a crown-like structure and three membrane fusion S2 subunits that form a stalk. Each S1 subunit contains two domains, an N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD). PdCoV S1-NTD has the same structural fold as alpha- and betacoronavirus S1-NTDs as well as host galectins, and it recognizes sugar as its potential receptor. PdCoV S1-CTD has the same structural fold as alphacoronavirus S1-CTDs, but its structure differs from that of betacoronavirus S1-CTDs. PdCoV S1-CTD binds to an unidentified receptor on host cell surfaces. PdCoV S2 is locked in the prefusion conformation by structural restraint of S1 from a different monomeric subunit. PdCoV spike possesses several structural features that may facilitate immune evasion by the virus, such as its compact structure, concealed receptor-binding sites, and shielded critical epitopes. Overall, this study reveals that deltacoronavirus spikes are structurally and evolutionally more closely related to alphacoronavirus spikes than to betacoronavirus spikes; it also has implications for the receptor recognition, membrane fusion, and immune evasion by deltacoronaviruses as well as coronaviruses in general. IMPORTANCE In this study, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) spike protein at a 3.3-Å resolution. This is the first atomic structure of a spike protein from the deltacoronavirus genus, which is divergent in amino acid sequences from the well-studied alpha- and betacoronavirus spike proteins. Here, we described the overall structure of the PdCoV spike and the detailed structure of each of its structural elements. Moreover, we analyzed the functions of each of the structural elements. Based on the structures and functions of these structural elements, we discussed the evolution of PdCoV spike protein in relation to the spike proteins from other coronavirus genera.

Recent autopsy series indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect both tubular and glomerular cells. Whereas tubular cell infiltration may contribute to acute kidney injury, data on a potential clinical correlative to glomerular affection is rare. We describe the first case of nephrotic syndrome in the context of COVID-19 in a renal transplant recipient. A 35 year old male patient received a kidney allograft for primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Three months posttransplant a recurrence of podocytopathy was successfully managed by plasma exchange, ivIG, and a conversion from tacrolimus to belatacept (initial proteinuria > 6 g/l decreased to 169 mg/l). Six weeks later he was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed a second increase of proteinuria (5.6 g/l). Renal allograft biopsy revealed diffuse podocyte effacement and was positive for SARS-CoV-2 in RNA in-situ hybridation indicating a SARS-CoV-2 associated recurrence of podocytopathy. Noteworthy, nephrotic proteinuria resolved spontaneously after recovering from COVID-19. The present case expands the spectrum of renal involvement in COVID-19 from acute tubular injury to podocytopathy in renal transplant recipients. Thus, it may be wise to test for SARS-CoV-2 prior to initiation of immunosuppression in new onset glomerulopathy during the pandemic.

AS01 is included in recently developed vaccines against malaria and varicella zoster virus. Like for many other adjuvants, induction of adaptive immunity by AS01 is highly dependent on the ability to recruit and activate dendritic cells (DCs) that migrate to the draining lymph node for T and B cell stimulation. The objective of this study was to more precisely address the contribution of the different conventional (cDC) and monocyte-derived DC (MC) subsets in the orchestration of the adaptive immune response after immunization with AS01 adjuvanted vaccine. The combination of MPL and QS-21 in AS01 induced strong recruitment of CD26(+)XCR1(+) cDC1s, CD26(+)CD172(+) cDC2s and a recently defined CCR2-dependent CD64-expressing inflammatory cDC2 (inf-cDC2) subset to the draining lymph node compared to antigen alone, while CD26(-)CD64(+)CD88(+) MCs were barely detectable. At 24 h post-vaccination, cDC2s and inf-cDC2s were superior amongst the different subsets in priming antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells, while simultaneously presenting antigen to CD8(+) T cells. Diphtheria toxin (DT) mediated depletion of all DCs prior to vaccination completely abolished adaptive immune responses, while depletion 24 h after vaccination mainly affected CD8(+) T cell responses. Vaccinated mice lacking Flt3 or the chemokine receptor CCR2 showed a marked deficit in inf-cDC2 recruitment and failed to raise proper antibody and T cell responses. Thus, the adjuvant activity of AS01 is associated with the potent activation of subsets of cDC2s, including the newly described inf-cDC2s.",2021-01-14,"Bosteels, Cedric; Fierens, Kaat; De Prijck, Sofie; Van Moorleghem, Justine; Vanheerswynghels, Manon; De Wolf, Caroline; Chalon, Aurélie; Collignon, Catherine; Hammad, Hamida; Didierlaurent, Arnaud M.; Lambrecht, Bart N.",Front Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cebfc963d00541f4d2b87a1c4e9ca3da2b7e99e8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7841299.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.606805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519816/,231597670.0

A View from North America,10.3998/jep.1645,,,unk,"In mid-March 2020, a rash of emergency “lockdown” orders from state governors confined millions of North American workers to their homes. Students suddenly needed to flip from classroom-based to remote instruction. Scholars in the humanities could no longer get to archives. Movement restrictions cut off the opportunity to travel for fieldwork and conference attendance almost overnight. As publishers and librarians dealt with the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic on their personal lives and relationships, they also embarked on a massive experiment in transforming access to scholarly information. Rather than being a unique benefit only available to members of a library subscriber’s “gated community,” access to hundreds of thousands of books and journal articles suddenly became freely available globally. That access, of course, had severe limitations. It was temporary (most programs expired at the end of August 2020), only available to users with an internet connection, and far from comprehensive in its coverage.

AIM: To describe the spatiotemporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs in Wuhan, China. METHODS: In this study, an open-source dataset of HCW diagnoses was provided. A geographical detector technique was then used to investigate the impacts of hospital level, type, distance from the infection source, and other external indicators of HCW infections. FINDINGS: The number of daily HCW infections over time in Wuhan followed a log-normal distribution, with its mean observed on January 23(rd), 2020, and a standard deviation of 10.8 days. The implementation of high-impact measures, such as the lockdown of the city, may have increased the probability of HCW infections in the short term, especially for those in the outer ring of Wuhan. The infection of HCWs in Wuhan exhibited clear spatial heterogeneity. The number of HCW infections was higher in the central city and lower in the outer city. CONCLUSION: HCW infections displayed significant spatial autocorrelation and dependence. Factor analysis revealed that hospital level and type had an even greater impact on HCW infections; third-class and general hospitals closer to infection sources were correlated with especially high risks of infection.",2021-02-06,"Wang, P.; Ren, H.; Zhu, X.; Fu, X.; Liu, H.; Hu, T.",J Hosp Infect,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5028cf820df2794d3c6be199383fff995dd5cea8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7985129.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670121000463; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670121000463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33561504/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2021.02.002,229188838.0

This semi-continuous process uses two identical columns operating either in interconnected or in batch mode, thus enabling the internal recycle of the portions of the eluting stream which do not comply with purity specifications. Because of this feature, which actually results in the simulated countercurrent movement of the stationary phase with respect to the mobile one, the yield-purity trade-off typical of traditional batch preparative chromatography can be alleviated. Moreover, the purification process can be completely automatized. Aim of this work is to present a simple procedure for the development of the MCSGP process based on a single batch experiment, in the case of a therapeutic peptide of industrial relevance. This allowed to recover roughly 90% of the injected glucagon in a purified pool with a purity of about 90%. A comparison between the performance of the MCSGP process and the classical single column batch process indicates that percentage increase in the recovery of target product is +23% when transferring the method from batch conditions to MCSGP, with an unchanged purity of around 89%.

The basic PEC process refers to the oxidation or reduction reactions between electrochemical active species in solution and photoactive materials that occurred at the electrode/electrolyte interface during illumination. In recent years, the PEC biosensing approaches have also been developed by the combination of the PEC technique with bioanalysis, where the interaction between biological recognition element and analyte influences a photocurrent signal. This involves the charge and energy transfer of PEC reaction between electron donor/acceptor and photoactive material upon light irradiation. Coupling the advantages of PEC bioanalysis and aptamers has provided new concepts for highly selective and sensitive biosensors development, applicable in human health monitoring and environmental protection. In a typical assay, a photoactive material converts the affinity binding properties of aptamers into a detectable electrical signal, presenting an innovative method for probing numerous aptamer–analyte interactions. Using different aptamer probes aiming for specific purposes, more sensing strategies with rational design and exquisite signaling mechanisms have been proposed. This review concentrated on the current topic of PEC aptasensors that are used for the detection of viruses. The prospects in this area are also discussed.

The biggest challenge with hydrogen as a renewable energy carrier is the storage and delivery system’s complexity. Therefore, other media such as ammonia for indirect storage are now being considered. Research has shown that at reasonable pressures, ammonia is easily contained as a liquid. In this form, energy density is approximately half of that of gasoline and ten times more than batteries. Ammonia can provide effective storage of renewable energy through its existing storage and distribution network. In this article, we aimed to analyse the previous studies and the current research on the preparation of ammonia as a next-generation renewable energy carrier. The study focuses on technical advances emerging in ammonia synthesis technologies, such as photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and plasmacatalysis. Ammonia is now also strongly regarded as fuel in the transport, industrial and power sectors and is relatively more versatile in reducing CO2 emissions. Therefore, the utilisation of ammonia as a renewable energy carrier plays a significant role in reducing GHG emissions.

Exercise has the potential to improve overall health in several diseases, but evidence remains scant in c-TA. The main objective of this study was to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic effects of exercise in c-TA. Methods This was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, to test the effects of a home-based, exercise intervention vs. standard of care in c-TA patients in remission. The primary outcomes were arterial inflammation, assessed by [18F] FDG- PET/MRI and systemic inflammatory markers. Secondary outcomes included, physical activity levels, functionality, body composition, disease-related parameters, and quality of life. Results Thirty-seven patients were assessed for eligibility, which represents the total number of c-TA patients being followed by the three specialized medical ambulatory services in Sao Paulo. After exclusions, fourteen c-TA patients (71.4% females) aged 12-25 years were randomly allocated into exercised (n=5) and non-exercised groups (n=9). Exercise did not exacerbate arterial inflammation. In fact, exercised patients had a reduction in the frequency of vessel segments with severe inflammation, whereas the non-exercised patients had an opposite response (P=0.007). Greater improvements in visceral fat, steps per day, functionality and physical component SF-36 were observed in the exercised patients (P ≤ 0.05). Conclusions Exercise is safe and may improve visceral fat, physical activity levels, functionality, and physical component SF-36 in c-TA patients. Thus, exercise arises as a novel, evidence-based intervention to improve general health in c-TA.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: CT data of 115 patients with respiratory symptoms suspected for COVID-19 disease were retrospectively analyzed. Based on the results of nasopharyngeal swab, patients were divided into two main groups, COVID-19 positive (C +) and COVID-19 negative (C-), respectively. C- patients, however, presented with interstitial lung involvement. A subgroup of C-, COVID-19-like (CL), were considered as highly suggestive of COVID pneumonia at CT. Radiomic features were extracted from the whole lungs. A dual machine learning (ML) model approach was used. The first one excluded CL patients from the training set, eventually included on the test set. The second model included the CL patients also in the training set. RESULTS: The first model classified C + and C- pneumonias with AUC of 0.83. CL median response (0.80) was more similar to C + (0.92) compared to C- (0.17). Radiomic footprints of CL were similar to the C + ones (possibly false negative swab test). The second model, however, merging C + with CL patients in the training set, showed a slight decrease in classification performance (AUC = 0.81). CONCLUSION: Whole lung ML models based on radiomics can classify C + and C- interstitial pneumonia. This may help in the correct management of patients with clinical and radiological stigmata of COVID-19, however presenting with a negative swab test. CL pneumonia was similar to C + pneumonia, albeit with slightly different radiomic footprints.",2021,"Cardobi, Nicolò; Benetti, Giulio; Cardano, Giuseppe; Arena, Cinzia; Micheletto, Claudio; Cavedon, Carlo; Montemezzi, Stefania",,,#1245730,,,,,235205862.0

In this study, we collected Reddit data from 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic) from the subreddits communities associated with 8 universities, applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and trained graphical neural networks with social media data, to study how the pandemic has affected people's emotions and psychological states compared to the pre-pandemic era. Specifically, we first applied a pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) to learn embedding from the semantic information of Reddit messages and trained a graph attention network (GAT) for sentiment classification. The usage of GAT allows us to leverage the relational information among the messages during training.

METHODS: Computerized literature searches were performed from four search engines. The studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studies were screened using Covidence (Cochrane tool) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement standards (PRISMA-2009). A total 2645 studies were initially retrieved, of which a total of 17 studies met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers, blinded to each other, evaluated level and strength of evidence using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence and QualSyst, respectively. RESULTS: Dysphagia prevalence ranged from 16 to 78% among the eligible studies. Studies varied in operational definitions defining swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia) and method used to assess swallowing function. Approximately 70% of eligible studies demonstrated strong methodological quality. The majority of studies (n = 11; 65%) reported pharyngeal swallowing impairments in patients with OSAS, including delayed initiation of pharyngeal swallow and penetration/aspiration. CONCLUSION: This systematic review describes swallowing function in patients with OSAS. However, due to the variability in defining OSAS and dysphagia, in the assessment method used to determine dysphagia, and heterogeneity of study designs, true prevalence is difficult to determine. Clinicians involved in the management of OSAS patients should employ validated assessment measures to determine if swallow dysfunction is present.",2020,"Bhutada, Ankita M; Broughton, William A; Focht Garand, Kendrea L",Sleep Breath,,#covidwho-1453831,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32062752/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-020-02037-w,211128176.0

Here, we test the participation of KCa-channels in human heart explant-derived cell (EDC) physiology and therapeutic potential. TRAM34-sensitive KCa3.1-channels, encoded by the KCNN4 gene, are exclusively expressed in therapeutically bioactive EDC subfractions and maintain a strongly polarized resting potential; whereas therapeutically inert EDCs lack KCa3.1 channels and exhibit depolarized resting potentials. Somatic gene transfer of KCNN4 results in membrane hyperpolarization and increases intracellular [Ca2+], which boosts cell-proliferation and the production of pro-healing cytokines/nanoparticles. Intramyocardial injection of EDCs after KCNN4-gene overexpression markedly increases the salutary effects of EDCs on cardiac function, viable myocardium and peri-infarct neovascularization in a well-established murine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Eventually, this impacts negatively towards work productivity and other related parameters including concentration, stress, and mood while at work. One of the key factors that causes this negative work experience is directly linked to the available seating arrangements. In this paper, we conduct an analysis to understand various seating preferences of 37 workers with varying demographics, using the data collected pre-COVID-19, and analyse the findings in the context of hybrid workplace settings.

Herein, a palladium-catalyzed direct and specific C-7 acylation of indolines in the presence of an easily removed directing group was developed. This strategy usually is considered as a practical strategy for the preparation of acylated indoles because indoline can be easily converted to indole under oxidation conditions.

Coxiella burnetii–induced human Q fever is one of the most widespread neglected zoonosis. The main animal reservoirs responsible for C. burnetii transmission to humans are domesticated ruminants, primarily goats, sheep, and cattle. Although studies are still too sparse to draw definitive conclusions, the most recent C. burnetii serosurvey studies conducted in herds and farms in Africa, North Africa, Arabian Peninsula, and Asia highlighted that seroprevalence was strikingly higher in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) than in other ruminants. The C. burnetii seroprevalence in camel herds can reach more than 60% in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan, and 70 to 80% in Algeria and Chad, respectively. The highest seroprevalence was in female camels with a previous history of abortion. Moreover, C. burnetii infection was reported in ticks of the Hyalomma dromedarii and Hyalomma impeltatum species collected on camels. Even if dromedary camels represent <3% of the domesticated ruminants in the countries of the Mediterranean basin Southern coast, these animals play a major socioeconomic role for millions of people who live in the arid zones of Africa, Middle East, and Asia. In Chad and Somalia, camels account for about 7 and 21% of domesticated ruminants, respectively. To meet the growing consumers demand of camel meat and milk (>5 million tons/year of both raw and pasteurized milk according to the Food and Agriculture Organization) sustained by a rapid increase of population (growth rate: 2.26–3.76 per year in North Africa), dromedary camel breeding tends to increase from the Maghreb to the Arabic countries. Because of possible long-term persistence of C. burnetii in camel hump adipocytes, this pathogen could represent a threat for herds and breeding farms and ultimately for public health. Because this review highlights a hyperendemia of C. burnetii in dromedary camels, a proper screening of herds and breeding farms for C. burnetii is urgently needed in countries where camel breeding is on the rise. Moreover, the risk of C. burnetii transmission from camel to human should be further evaluated.",2020-11-05,"Devaux, Christian A.; Osman, Ikram Omar; Million, Matthieu; Raoult, Didier",Front Vet Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/09b13f636982e03729575a5baf95e3f2292eac96.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7674558.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251255/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.558481,226248042.0

Pmsf is a functional measure of the effective intravascular volume status. This study aims to assess the precision of the Pmsf-arm measurement. Pmsf-arm was measured by inflating a pneumatic tourniquet around the upper arm 50 mmHg above systolic pressure for 60 s, four times consecutively, with an interval of 5 min. Arterial (Pa) and venous pressure (Pv) were recorded every 10 s. Pa-Pv difference was calculated to determine the stop-flow time. The coefficient error (CE) was determined and used to derive the least significant change (LSC) in Pmsf-arm that this technique could reliably detect. The rANOVA test was used to compare repeated measurements of the four determinations of Pmsf-arm. 80 measurements of Pmsf-arm were studied in 20 patients. Pa and Pv equalised after 60 s of inflation (Pa-Pv difference 0 ± 0.01 mmHg). There were no significant differences of Pmsf-arm values among determinations. For a single measurement, the CE was 5 % (±2 %) and the LSC was 14 % (±5 %). Averaging two, three and four measurements the CE improves to 4 % (±1 %), 3 % (±1 %) and 3 % (±1 %) respectively, and the LSC was reduced to 10 % (±4 %), 8 % (±3 %) and 7 % (±3 %) respectively.

Magnetic resonance imaging is a well-accepted and validated technique for the identification of deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) lesions, but has some practical and financial drawbacks. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) has been proposed as a suitable alternative, but validation studies are currently lacking. OBJECTIVE To assess the accuracy of CECT for the identification and characterisation of deep digital flexor tendinopathy. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study of CT, macroscopic and histological findings of the DDFT. METHODS Plain and CECT scans were acquired of 23 limbs of 16 horses with clinical lameness localised to the foot. All horses had lesions of the DDFT that were identified and characterised with CT and CECT with respect to their anatomic location and extent. All horses underwent post mortem examination and gross abnormalities were described. Samples of the DDFT were taken at specific sites (lesion and nonlesion) for histological evaluation. Macroscopic and histological outcomes were compared with CECT findings. RESULTS Of 67 sites in 23 DDFTs that were evaluated, 42 sites in 18 tendons had lesions on CECT images. These 42 sites also had lesions on macroscopic evaluation. There were 3 false negative and 3 false positive results identified on CECT.

Numerous disaster-type ventilators are available, but few evaluations have been performed. OBJECTIVE To compare simple, lightweight, and handy ventilators that could be used in the initial care of patients with respiratory distress. METHODS We bench-tested 4 volume-cycled ventilators (Carevent ALS, EPV100, Pneupac VR1, and Medumat Easy) and 2 pressure-cycled ventilators (Oxylator EMX and VAR-Plus). We studied their general physical characteristics, sonometry, gas consumption, technical performance, ergonomy, and user-friendliness. With a test lung we assessed performance at F(IO(2)) of 0.50 and 1.0, set compliance of 30, 70, and 120 mL/cm H(2)O, and set resistance of 5, 10, and 20 cm H(2)O/L/s. To study user-friendliness and ergonomy we conducted, in randomized order, 7 or 8 objective, quantitative tests and 2 subjective tests. RESULTS Compliance and resistance strongly affected tidal volume with the pressure-cycled ventilators (from 418 ± 49 mL to 1,377 ± 444 mL with the VAR-Plus, at the lowest pressure level), whereas the volume-cycled ventilators provided a consistent tidal volume in the face of changing test lung characteristics. CONCLUSIONS We are concerned that the pressure-cycled ventilators did not provide a consistent tidal volume, and under certain conditions the volume delivered would be unsafe (too large or too small). Most of the volume-cycled ventilators proved to be technically efficient and reliable.

METHODS A retrospective chart review from August 2005 to April 2007 was performed identifying all patients who underwent laparoscopic repair of perforated marginal ulcer after RYGB at one hospital. The perforation was repaired either by laparoscopic primary suture closure followed by application of an omental patch or by laparoscopic Graham patch without primary suture repair. Operative time, duration of hospitalization, postoperative follow-up, and postoperative complications were recorded. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS Six patients underwent laparoscopic repair of a perforated marginal ulcer. Operative time was 101.8 ± 50 minutes with a mean hospitalization of 5.3 ± 2.7 days. Follow-up was 6.2 ± 7.5 months. Postoperative complications included 2 patients with nausea and vomiting related to an exposed suture at the gastrojejunostomy, 1 patient with chronic gastritis, and 1 patient developed a stricture at the gastrojejunostomy. CONCLUSIONS We present the largest series to date of laparoscopic repair of perforated marginal ulcers utilizing an omental patch for repair. We demonstrate that a laparoscopic repair can be completed in a reasonable operative time, with minimal postoperative hospitalization, and low associated morbidity. Patients who develop a perforated marginal ulcer after RYGB can be safely and effectively treated with laparoscopic repair with an omental patch.",2011,"Wheeler, Andrew A; de la Torre, Roger A; Fearing, Nicole M",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

One possibility to control the pandemic is to induce sterilizing immunity through the induction and maintenance of neutralizing antibodies preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 from entering human cells to replicate in. METHODS: We report the construction and in vitro and in vivo characterization of a SARS‐CoV‐2 subunit vaccine (PreS‐RBD) based on a structurally folded recombinant fusion protein consisting of two SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein receptor‐binding domains (RBD) fused to the N‐ and C‐terminus of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen PreS to enable the two unrelated proteins serving as immunologic carriers for each other. RESULTS: PreS‐RBD, but not RBD alone, induced a robust and uniform RBD‐specific IgG response in rabbits. Currently available genetic SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines induce mainly transient IgG(1) responses in vaccinated subjects whereas the PreS‐RBD vaccine induced RBD‐specific IgG antibodies consisting of an early IgG(1) and sustained IgG(4) antibody response in a SARS‐CoV‐2 naive subject. PreS‐RBD‐specific IgG antibodies were detected in serum and mucosal secretions, reacted with SARS‐CoV‐2 variants, including the omicron variant of concern and the HBV receptor‐binding sites on PreS of currently known HBV genotypes. PreS‐RBD‐specific antibodies of the immunized subject more potently inhibited the interaction of RBD with its human receptor ACE2 and their virus‐neutralizing titers (VNTs) were higher than median VNTs in a random sample of healthy subjects fully immunized with registered SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines or in COVID‐19 convalescent subjects. CONCLUSION: The PreS‐RBD vaccine has the potential to serve as a combination vaccine for inducing sterilizing immunity against SARS‐CoV‐2 and HBV by stopping viral replication through the inhibition of cellular virus entry.",2022-04-15,"Gattinger, Pia; Kratzer, Bernhard; Tulaeva, Inna; Niespodziana, Katarzyna; Ohradanova‐Repic, Anna; Gebetsberger, Laura; Borochova, Kristina; Garner‐Spitzer, Erika; Trapin, Doris; Hofer, Gerhard; Keller, Walter; Baumgartner, Isabella; Tancevski, Ivan; Khaitov, Musa; Karaulov, Alexander; Stockinger, Hannes; Wiedermann, Ursula; Pickl, Winfried F.; Valenta, Rudolf",Allergy,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/33cc90bca527871791d1dae5c6189508493f6f9f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9111473.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35357709/; https://doi.org/10.1111/all.15305,247840870.0

Previous studies by our group and other groups have demonstrated that the depletion of cellular cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) reduces the proliferation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a porcine Arterivirus that has been devastating the swine industry worldwide for over two decades. However, how PRRSV infection regulates cholesterol synthesis is not fully understood. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection upregulated the activity of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), which subsequently activated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, to increase the levels of cellular cholesterol. By screening the PRRSV-encoded proteins, we showed that nsp4 dominated the upregulation of cellular cholesterol, independently of the 3C-like protease activity of nsp4. A mutation analysis showed that domain I (amino acids 1–80) of PRRSV nsp4 interacted with PR65 alpha (PR65α), the structural subunit, and PP2Ac, the catalytic subunit, of PP2A. Importantly, domain I of nsp4 inhibited Sendai virus-induced interferon β production, and this inhibitory effect was eliminated by Lovastatin, an HMGCR inhibitor, indicating that the upregulation of cellular cholesterol by nsp4 is a strategy used by PRRSV to suppress the antiviral innate immunity of its host. Collectively, we here demonstrated the mechanism by which PRRSV regulates cellular cholesterol synthesis and reported a novel strategy by which PRRSV evades its host's antiviral innate immune response.",2021-12-08,"Ke, Wenting; Zhou, Yanrong; Lai, Yinan; Long, Siwen; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo",Redox Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ffcf457366ee91947967df0a3e54db08f1cb24f8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8758914.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8758914/,

HA cleavage activation is required for virus-endosome membrane fusion and the subsequent release of the influenza virus genome into the cytoplasm. Previous studies have determined that HA cleavage is most likely driven by either membrane-bound or extracellular trypsin-like proteases that reside in the respiratory tract. However, there is still uncertainty regarding which proteases are critical for HA cleavage in vivo. Therefore, further investigation of HA cleavage activation is needed in order to gain insight into the critical proteases involved. Matriptase is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family that is highly expressed in a membrane-bound form throughout the respiratory tract. One feature of matriptase is that, once activated, the catalytic domain is secreted into the extracellular space and so serves as a functional extracellular protease. In this study, we have determined that the secreted, catalytic domain of matriptase has the ability to cleave and activate HA from the influenza virus H1 subtype but not the H2 and H3 subtypes. Furthermore, matriptase selectively cleaved the HA of particular strains within the H1 subtype, revealing both subtype and H1 strain specificity. Matriptase was also found to activate thrombolytic zymogens that have been shown to cleave and activate the influenza virus HA. Our data demonstrate that matriptase has the ability to cleave HA directly or indirectly by activating HA-cleaving zymogens.",2012,"Hamilton, Brian S; Gludish, David W J; Whittaker, Gary R",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00306-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22811538/,206792846.0

Currently India is facing third wave of COVID-19 pandemic and going through a severe crisis. Within short span of time, the variant has shown high transmissibility and capability of evading the immune response generated against natural infection and vaccination. The immune escape potential of Omicron is a serious concern and further needs to be explored. In the present study, we have assessed the IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) response in breakthrough individuals vaccinated with two doses ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (n=25), breakthrough individuals vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (n=8) and unvaccinated individuals (n=6). All these individuals were infected with Omicron variant. The IgG antibody activity in the sera of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA breakthrough individuals was comparable with S1-RBD, while it was lesser in BNT162b2 mRNA breakthrough individuals with N protein and inactivated whole antigen IgG ELISA. BNT162b2 mRNA breakthrough individuals showed moderate reduction in NAb GMTs compared to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against Alpha, Beta and Delta. However, 3-fold higher reduction was observed with omicron variant in BNT162b2 mRNA than ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Apparently, Alpha variant was modestly resistant to the sera of unvaccinated individuals than Beta, Delta and Omicron.

OBJECTIVE To report the outcomes of WUS patients with large vessel occlusions, selected for intervention based on Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and treated with stent retrievers or primary aspiration thrombectomy. METHODS Data were collected retrospectively for each consecutive WUS patient undergoing mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever or primary aspiration catheter between February 2015 and September 2016. ASPECTS ≥ 6 was used as the primary imaging criterion for offering thrombectomy in these WUS patients. Main outcomes were the in-hospital improvement in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the occurrence of symptomatic hemorrhage.

To date, little is known about the characteristics of pulmonary auscultation in novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to explore the features and clinical significance of pulmonary auscultation in COVID-19 pneumonia using an electronic stethoscope in isolation wards. METHODS This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at Wuhan Red-Cross Hospital during the period from January 27, 2020, to February 12, 2020. Standard auscultation with an electronic stethoscope was performed and electronic recordings of breath sounds were analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients with average age of 60.6 years were enrolled. The most common symptoms were cough (73.7%) during auscultation. Most cases had bilateral lesions (96.4%) such as multiple ground-glass opacities (69.1%) and fibrous stripes (21.8%). High-quality auscultation recordings (98.8%) were obtained, and coarse breath sounds, wheezes, coarse crackles, fine crackles, and Velcro crackles were identified. Most cases had normal breath sounds in upper lungs, but the proportions of abnormal breath sounds increased in the basal fields where Velcro crackles were more commonly identified at the posterior chest. The presence of fine and coarse crackles detected 33/39 patients with ground-glass opacities (sensitivity 84.6% and specificity 12.5%) and 8/9 patients with consolidation (sensitivity 88.9% and specificity 15.2%), while the presence of Velcro crackles identified 16/39 patients with ground-glass opacities (sensitivity 41% and specificity 81.3%). CONCLUSIONS The abnormal breath sounds in COVID-19 pneumonia had some consistent distributive characteristics and to some extent correlated with the radiologic features.

aqq8pdnf,,WHO,Gaussian position weighted center of gravity algorithm for multiplexed readout,,,,unk,"Readout signal multiplexing is a commonly used method to reduce the electronics cost in PET systems, and calculation of the scintillation coordinates typically is done by using a Center of Gravity (CoG) technique due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. This comes with a drawback, since CoG has a non-linear response at the periphery of the detector due to the lack of weights beyond the detector. Detectors with multiplexed readout that are based on finely segmented scintillators and coarsely segmented photosensors are known to suffer from the so called edge effect where a pile-up of the reconstructed coordinates from the edge crystals is observed. This may lead to incorrect assignment of the events to crystal pixels and result in formation of erroneous lines of response causing a degradation of spatial resolution and reduction of image contrast. To overcome abovementioned limitations in gamma ray detectors with multiplexed photosensor readout, we propose to use modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity technique for calculation of gamma ray interaction position. Here the proposed method is applied to PET detectors with 24×24 LYSO crystals read out by 8 × 8 SiPM array with 64:16 row/column multiplexing. Furthermore, we compared the modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity (PW-CoG) and Truncated Center of Gravity (TCoG) coordinate reconstruction methods. It was observed that both algorithms resolve peaks corresponding to events registered in the crystal pixels on the periphery of the crystal array, however peak-to-valley ratios and crystal resolvability metrics for PW-CoG algorithm are generally greater.",2020,"Poladyan, Harutyun; Bubon, Oleksandr; Teymurazyan, Aram; Senchurov, Sergii; Reznik, Alla",Phys. med. biol,,#32408285,,,,,218648746.0

While disease-free survival (DFS) was not different between groups in ITT analysis, in PT analysis the vaccine group showed improved 24-month DFS (62.9% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: This phase IIb trial of TLPLDC vaccine administered to patients with resected stage III/IV melanoma shows TLPLDC is well-tolerated and improves DFS in patients who complete the primary vaccine series. This suggests patients who do not recur early benefit from TLPLDC in preventing future recurrence from melanoma. A phase III trial of TLPLDC + checkpoint inhibitor versus checkpoint inhibitor alone in patients with advanced, surgically resected melanoma is under development. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02301611.

Besides, a brief role of NSP6 in autophagosome formation, this is not studied significantly. Also, there is no structural information available till date. Based on the prediction by TMHMM server for transmembrane prediction, it is found that the N-terminal residues (1-11), middle region residues (91-112) and C-terminal residues (231-290) lies outside the membrane. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations showed that NSP6 consisting of helical structures, whereas membrane outside lying region (91-112) showed partial helicity, which further used as model and obtain disordered type conformation after 1.5 microsecond. Whereas, the residues 231-290 has both helical and beta sheet conformations in its structure model. A 200ns simulations resulted in the loss of beta sheet structures, while helical regions remained intact. Further, we have characterized the residue 91-112 by using reductionist approaches. The NSP6 (91-112) was found disordered like in isolation, which gain helical conformation in different biological mimic environmental conditions. These studies can be helpful to study NSP6 (91-112) interactions with host proteins, where different protein conformation might play significant role. The present study adds up more information about NSP6 protein aspect, which could be exploited for its host protein interaction and pathogenesis.

Quite unexpectedly, hospitals and health care workers became facilitators of disease diffusion. This experience has demonstrated the need for a comprehensive disease control strategy. AIMS The aims are threefold. First, to examine the subtle and changing spatial characteristics of SARS during the short but critical period of its rapid spread in the Greater Toronto Area. Second, to make salient three paradoxes, and their associated dilemmas, faced by nurses and other health care professionals challenged with caring for the sick and containing the rapid spread of the disease. Third, to propose some ways of approaching these dilemmas, as well as some broader preventative and mitigating strategies. METHODS The crosscutting concepts of 'clinical uncertainty' and 'flow of human contacts' are used to explain disease transmission characteristics and urban spatial diffusion and to guide the particular strategies developed. Evidence for the paper comes from public health records, governmental and non-governmental health statements and the initial epidemiological research on SARS. Direct insights are also gained from recent first-hand experiences of Toronto's health care system during the crisis. DISCUSSION The concepts of clinical uncertainty and the flow of human contacts provide in-depth insights that complement the findings of large-scale epidemiological studies, and help operationalize their general calls for enhanced control measures. The comprehensive disease control strategy proposed includes the creation of a hospital infrastructure specific to the containment of biological threats; an advisory coalition of disease control specialists; the development of a biological threat-and-containment simulation laboratory and three specific programmes in patient safety, risk assessment and community mobilization. CONCLUSION It is argued that containment alone, while a necessary and urgent priority, cannot be seen as an end in itself and might better be understood as one possible trajectory within a comprehensive problem-solving strategy. The experiences in Toronto may offer insights to other cities and countries that currently lack such strategies and hence may be vulnerable to similar outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases.",2004,"Affonso, Dyanne D; Andrews, Gavin J; Jeffs, Lianne",Journal of advanced nursing,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15012634/,33812482.0

There are little data on the effect of IST reduction and early graft function after COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective study on 45 consecutive KT recipients followed at the University Hospital of Modena who tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR analysis. We detailed clinical management and outcomes of these patients. Median age of patients was 56.1 (interquartile range, [IQR] 47.3-61.1) years with a predominance of male (64.4%) and patients of Caucasian origin (91.1%). Kidney transplantation vintage was 10.1 (2.7-16) years, and more than half (55.6%) was on triple IST. Therapeutic management included antimetabolite (62.8%) and calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal (22.2%), and suspension of IST in severely ill patients. Of the 45 patients, 88.9% became symptomatic and 40% required hospitalization. Overall mortality accounted for 17.8% (n=8). There were no differences in outcomes between full- and reduced-dose IST at the end of follow-up. Overall, early graft function after COVID-19 showed a stable and unmodified kidney function in 95% of survivors. Risk factors for death were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.01-1.39), and years spent on immunosuppression (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 0.38-10.03-4.9). One patient experienced symptomatic reinfection with COVID-19 after primary infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. COVID-19 impacted the graft and general survival of KT recipients.

However, it has been rarely reported in the setting of the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection or sarcomatous tumors. RCVS might be the initial manifestations of COVID-19 infection or noncatecholamine producing masses including sarcoma. CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old male who developed COVID-19–related symptoms followed by rapid onset of severe headaches in the setting of persistently elevated blood pressure (BP). Brain imaging showed multifocal arterial narrowing in the anterior and posterior circulation consistent with RCVS. Serial imaging demonstrated resolution of the arterial narrowing after BP control was achieved with improvement in the patient’s headaches. Further investigation for secondary causes of the patient’s elevated BP revealed a right renal mass, and the patient underwent right nephrectomy, and the biopsy results confirmed the diagnosis of pleomorphic sarcoma. CONCLUSION: Our case suggests a possible association between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with development of RCVS, but further studies are needed to validate this observation, establish a causal relationship and define a pathophysiological mechanism.

Although working from home (WFH) is not a new phenomenon, it is new in its current scale and scope because of COVID-19. Against this background, we investigate the effect of WFH during the COVID-19 crisis on changes in leadership behaviors, and associated changes in perceived manager quality and productivity, at different hierarchical levels in organizations. Based on the literature, we develop two predictions in opposite directions. On the one hand, implementing WFH may force managers to show less direction and control and especially more delegation. On the other hand, research into the effects of exogenous shocks such as COVID-19, suggests that managers may become more controlling and delegate less. Consistent with the first prediction, we find that managers perceive they execute significantly less control and delegate more. Employees also perceive a significant decrease in control, however they perceive on average no change in delegation. Furthermore, and in line with the second prediction, employees of lower-level managers even report a significant decrease in delegation. Finally, our results show that increased delegation is associated with increased perceived productivity and higher manager quality. Together, these results suggest that in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the effectiveness of WFH might be hampered by the fact that required changes in leadership behaviors, in particular in delegation, are difficult to realize in times of crisis.",2022-05-03,"Stoker, Janka I.; Garretsen, Harry; Lammers, Joris",J Leadersh Organ Stud,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/490a7e0f7b4f9f9a55a9a9fcf23096de0e01bf90.json,,https://doi.org/10.1177/15480518211007452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35516094/,235502164.0

They allow continuous recording in real-life settings, potentially revealing previously uncaptured variabilities of biophysiological parameters and diseases. Adequate device accuracy is a prerequisite for meaningful research. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the heart rate recording accuracy in two previously unvalidated devices: Fitbit Charge 4 and Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2. METHODS: Participants performed a study protocol comprising 5 resting and sedentary, 2 low-intensity, and 3 high-intensity exercise phases, lasting an average of 19 minutes 27 seconds. Participants wore two wearables simultaneously during all activities: Fitbit Charge 4 and Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2. Reference heart rate data were recorded using a medically certified Holter electrocardiogram. The data of the reference and evaluated devices were synchronized and compared at 1-second intervals. The mean, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, Lin concordance correlation coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman plots were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 23 healthy adults (mean age 24.2, SD 4.6 years) participated in our study. Overall, and across all activities, the Fitbit Charge 4 slightly underestimated the heart rate, whereas the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 overestimated it (−1.66 beats per minute [bpm]/3.84 bpm). The Fitbit Charge 4 achieved a lower mean absolute error during resting and sedentary activities (seated rest: 7.8 vs 9.4; typing: 8.1 vs 11.6; laying down [left]: 7.2 vs 9.4; laying down [back]: 6.0 vs 8.6; and walking slowly: 6.8 vs 7.7 bpm), whereas the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 performed better during and after low- and high-intensity activities (standing up: 12.3 vs 9.0; walking fast: 6.1 vs 5.8; stairs: 8.8 vs 6.9; squats: 15.7 vs 6.1; resting: 9.6 vs 5.6 bpm). CONCLUSIONS: Device accuracy varied with activity. Overall, both devices achieved a mean absolute percentage error of just <10%. Thus, they were considered to produce valid results based on the limits established by previous work in the field. Neither device reached sufficient accuracy during seated rest or keyboard typing.

In addition, it is of interest to assess whether improvements in HIV-related knowledge may actually lead to increased engagement in preventive behaviours and ultimately lower HIV transmission. This study therefore aims to systematically review and meta-analyse the evidence for the effect of HIV-related knowledge interventions on 1) the improvement of HIV-related knowledge, 2) subsequent risk reduction behaviour (condom use), 3) lower incidence of HIV infection. METHODS A literature search was conducted using the Embase and Medline databases, returning 746 after duplicate removal. Following abstract and full-text screening, 36 studies were ultimately included in the final review. Meta-analyses were conducted in R, using random-effects models, for the HIV-related knowledge, condom use, and HIV incidence outcomes, where sufficient data were available. RESULTS Interventions assessed in the reviewed studies varied, including computer-based interventions, mass media campaigns, and peer education interventions. The interventions were generally found to be effective at improving HIV-related knowledge in the target population, with 10 studies reporting improved knowledge of risk reduction through condom use in the intervention group (out of 11 studies reporting data for this outcome), with 6 reporting these differences as significant (p < 0.05). Regarding knowledge of transmission routes, studies assessing peer education interventions often reported significant improvements in the intervention group. Meta-analysis results showed significantly higher odds among the intervention groups of correct knowledge of: risk reduction through condom use (OR: 3.09, 95%CI: 1.83-5.22, p < 0.0001), sexual transmission of HIV (OR: 5.86, 95%CI: 2.65-12.97, p < 0.001) and transmission through sharps (OR: 4.35, 95%CI = 3.21-5.90, p < 0.001), but non-significantly lower odds of HIV infection (OR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.66-1.41, p = 0.854). CONCLUSION Peer-education-based interventions appear to be particularly effective in facilitating the uptake of HIV-related knowledge, particularly pertaining to transmission routes. There is some evidence that improved knowledge of HIV transmission and prevention facilitates increased subsequent engagement in preventive measures, although this requires further exploration.

DESIGN: A series of six cross‐sectional telephone surveys of a random representative sample of adults living in Scotland. METHODS: Self‐reported adherence to three TRBs (physical distancing, wearing a face covering and handwashing), PMT, CS‐SRM, and SCT/RAA constructs, and sociodemographic variables were measured each week for 6 weeks (n = ~500 p/w; third June–15th July) via a 15 min telephone survey. RESULTS: Adherence was high (‘Always’ or ‘Most times’) throughout for physical distancing and handwashing, and, when mandated, for wearing a face covering. Older people were more adherent to all TRBs. Constructs from all three models predicted all three TRBs. Intention and self‐efficacy (SCT/RAA) were the only beliefs to predict to all three TRBs each week and for all groups equally; intention was the strongest predictor. The predictive utility of PMT and CS‐SRM varied by TRB and by group. Of note was the observation that several illness beliefs were associated with adherence only for those who believed they had not had COVID‐19.

Using survey data from two waves of a nationally representative, longitudinal study of life in lockdown in the United Kingdom (N = 1,406), we analyze the factors associated with belief in three origin theories related to COVID-19, namely that it 1) originated in a meat market in Wuhan, China;2) was developed in a lab in Wuhan, China;and 3) is caused by 5G mobile networks. Our findings suggest that political-psychological predispositions are strongly associated with belief in conspiracy theories about the virus, though the direction and effect sizes of these predictors vary depending on the specific content of each origin theory. For instance, belief in the Chinese lab conspiracy theory is strongly associated with right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and general conspiracy ideation, as well as less reliable news sources, distrust in scientists, and anxiety about the pandemic. Belief in the 5G network conspiracy theory is strongly associated with SDO, distrust in scientists, while less strongly with conspiracy ideation and information from social networks/media;RWA is strongly negatively associated with belief in the 5G conspiracy theory, with older and more wealthy individuals somewhat less likely to endorse it. The meat market origin theory is predicted by intolerance of uncertainty, ethnocentrism, COVID-19 anxiety, and less so by higher income, while distrust in scientists is negatively associated with this origin story. Finally, belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories is associated with negative public health behaviors such as unwillingness to social distance and vaccinate against the virus. Crucially, our findings suggest that the specific content of COVID-19 conspiracy theories likely determines which individuals may be most likely to endorse them.

Material and Objectives: Primary Objective: To study the proportion of non-adherence to treatment in patients with type 2 DM and factors responsible for it. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE To correlate the degree of glycemic control, presence of target organ damage and metabolic derangements with non-adherence to medication. METHODS A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on 100 patients of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Proportion of drug coverage (PDC) over the last 1 month was used to assess adherence. A questionnaire was used to collect information for variable factors responsible for non-adherence. The percentage of non-adherence and factors contributing were analyzed. OBSERVATION AND RESULTS Out of 100 patients with T2 DM (M:F:: 35:65); 56 patients had good (>80%) adherence, 13 patients had moderate (50-80%) adherence and 31 patients had poor (<50%) adherence to medication. Following factors were assessed for non-adherence; Amongst Drug-related factors; cost (43%;p<0.001), non-availability of drugs (39%;p<0.001) and long-term use of drugs (3%;p=0.017) were significantly associated with non-adherence to medication. None of the Insulin-related factors i.e. phobia (13.04%;p=0.441), negative impact (13.04%;p=0.441), less flexibility (60.86%;p=0.595), don't know the way of taking insulin (52.17%;p=0.983) and others (17.39%,p=0.67) were significantly associated with non-adherence. Amongst social factors:- Function(12%;p=0.881), no support (27%;p=0.005), patient not well (23%;p=0.004), travelling (42%,p=0.158) and illness in family (5%;p=0.658). No support from family and patient not well were significantly associated with non-adherence. None of the disease-related (duration, poor perception & unawareness) and psychological factors (forgetfulness & willful default) were significantly associated with non-adherence. Miscellaneous factors:- Frequency of visits (20%,p=0.034), lack of communication (53%,p<0.001) and SMBG related issues (74%,p=0.029) were significantly associated with non-adherence. Others factors like distance, covid-related and alternate therapy were not significantly associated with non-adherence. Patients with good adherence had significantly lower HbA1c (p=0.044).Patients with good adherence had lesser prevalence of target organ damage but it was not significantly associated with non-adherence except nephropathy (66%;p=0.039). Also, association of medication adherence with metabolic complications was found to be insignificant. CONCLUSION Non-adherence to medication in patients with Type 2 DM is significantly associated with cost of medication, non-availability of medication, long-term use, no support from family, patient not well, frequency of visits, lack of communication and SMBG related issues.

In this systematic review, we aim to identify and evaluate the literature documenting the outcomes associated with non-pharmacological interventions to improve nighttime sleep among long-term care residents. METHODS The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guided searches of five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) for articles reporting results of experimental or quasi-experimental studies conducted in long-term care settings (nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, or group homes) in which nighttime sleep was subjectively or objectively measured as a primary outcome. We categorized each intervention by its intended use and how it was administered. RESULTS Of the 54 included studies evaluating the effects of 25 different non-pharmacological interventions, more than half employed a randomized controlled trial design (n = 30); the others used a pre-post design with (n = 11) or without (n = 13) a comparison group. The majority of randomized controlled trials were at low risk for most types of bias, and most other studies met the standard quality criteria. The interventions were categorized as environmental interventions (n = 14), complementary health practices (n = 12), social/physical stimulation (n = 11), clinical care practices (n = 3), or mind-body practices (n = 3). Although there was no clear pattern of positive findings, three interventions had the most promising results: increased daytime light exposure, nighttime use of melatonin, and acupressure.

We aimed to compare the feasibility of laparoscopic splenectomy versus open splenectomy for massive splenomegaly from different surgical aspects in children. METHODS The data of children aged <12 years with massive splenomegaly who underwent splenectomy for hematologic disorders were retrospectively reviewed in 2 pediatric surgery centers from June 2004 until July 2012. RESULTS The study included 32 patients, 12 who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy versus 20 who underwent open splenectomy. The mean ages were 8.5 years and 8 years in the laparoscopic splenectomy group and open splenectomy group, respectively. The mean operative time was 180 minutes for laparoscopic splenectomy and 120 minutes for open splenectomy. The conversion rate was 8%. The mean amount of intraoperative blood loss was 60 mL in the laparoscopic splenectomy group versus 110 mL in the open splenectomy group. Postoperative atelectasis developed in 2 cases in the open splenectomy group (10%) and 1 case in the laparoscopic splenectomy group (8%). Oral feeding postoperatively resumed at a mean of 7.5 hours in the laparoscopic splenectomy group versus 30 hours in the open splenectomy group. The mean hospital stay was 36 hours in the laparoscopic splenectomy group versus 96 hours in the open splenectomy group. Postoperative pain was less in the laparoscopic splenectomy group. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic splenectomy for massive splenomegaly in children is safe and feasible. Although the operative time was significantly greater in the laparoscopic splenectomy group, laparoscopic splenectomy was associated with statistically significantly less pain, less blood loss, better recovery, and shorter hospital stay. Laparoscopic splenectomy for pediatric hematologic disorders should be the gold-standard approach regardless of the size of the spleen.",2014,"Hassan, Mohamed E; Al Ali, Khalid",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392624/,15663941.0

Recently, it has been shown that wearing face masks impairs social interaction by diminishing a person’s ability to read the emotion of their counterparts, an essential prerequisite to respond adequately in social situations. It is easily conceivable that this may have a tangible negative influence on the communication and relationship between patients and healthcare personnel. We therefore investigated whether it has an effect on how patients perceive healthcare professionals when physicians and nursing staff wear portrait photos with their smiling faces in addition to face masks. METHODS: During the study period of 16 days, the medical staff of our Department wore surgical face masks at all times during any kind of interaction with patients. In a pseudorandomized order, all members of our staff additionally affixed their portrait photos to their work clothes on 8 of the 16 days. After completion of their visit, 226 patients were interviewed anonymously in a cross-sectional study design using a questionnaire in which they rated the following three items: friendliness of staff, medical quality of treatment, and how well they felt taken care of during treatment in our Department. RESULTS: On days, on which staff wore photos, mean scores of the questionnaires were significantly higher than on non-photo days (p = 0.013; mean ± standard deviation = 92.8 ± 11.3 vs. 91.0 ± 12.6; median (range) = 97 (98) vs. 96 (76)). When analyzed separately, the increased scores were only significant for the item friendliness of staff (p = 0.009; mean ± standard deviation = 95.8 ± 6.3 vs. 92.2 ± 11.5; median (range) = 98 (39) vs. 97 (54)).

However, the large molecular size, complex impurity profile and unique secondary structure pose many challenges in the analysis of sgRNA by ion pairing reversed-phase liquid chromatography (IP-RPLC), the commonly used method. In this work, we developed a generic IP-RPLC method for guide RNA analysis. We found that large pore size of stationary phase was the most critical column parameter to achieve high resolution separation of sgRNA while particle structure, particle size and surface chemistry had less impact. Our results indicated that charge interaction was the most critical mechanism for retention and mass transfer had less impact on the performance of separation. An IP-RPLC/mass spectrometry (MS) method was also developed with a specific practice to reduce adducts and enable intact MS analysis of sgRNAs.

The present study aimed at assessing the impact of prior antidepressant treatment on brain function in currently depressed but unmedicated individuals by investigating for any differences between antidepressant-naïve vs. antidepressant-experienced subjects. Fifty right-handed patients (22 medication-naïve vs. 28 medication-experienced), suffering from major depression participated in the study. They all underwent a standardised clinical interview and psychometric assessment combined with neurobiological tests (brain SPECT, Dexamethasone Suppression Test, Dexfenfluramine Challenge Test, electro-oculogram, flash-electroretinogram and flash-visual evoked potentials and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials). No significant differences between medication-naïve and medication-experienced depressed subjects were found in terms of the neurobiological markers assessed, after controlling for age, sex, age at onset, number of depressive episodes, depression subtype (melancholic, atypical or undifferentiated) and severity of current episode. Unmedicated currently depressed patients, no matter their previous exposure to antidepressants, show similar changes in brain function. This does not necessarily mean that antidepressants do not have a long term effect on brain physiology, since not all patients relapse. However, it seems that those patients who relapse after stopping medication, seem to 'regress' to an 'as if never medicated' state, with regard to brain function. These findings might suggest that continuous maintenance treatment with antidepressants is essential for patients at high risk to relapse. Alternatively, they might suggest that our methodology assesses only a shallow and mainly state part of the pathophysiology of depression.",2013,"Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Gonda, Xenia; Andreoulakis, Elias; Fokas, Konstantinos; Iacovides, Apostolos",Journal of psychiatric research,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2013.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24074518/,11307389.0

To this end, researchers have relied on repeated cross-sectional (RCS) studies, in which different people from the same population participate on different measurement occasions. Also, researchers have relied on panel studies, in which the same group of people participate on different measurement occasions. However, few studies have directly tested whether participants' responses in RCS studies were similar to those found in panel studies. To address this gap, we compared the responses to 33 items, 28 of which were further grouped into four aggregates (Affections, Worries, States, Health concerns), over 8 weeks during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Denmark in a RCS study (overall N = 5,993, per measurement occasion 616 ≤ n ≤ 964) with the responses in a largely equivalent panel study (993 ≤ n ≤ 2,546 across measurement occasions). The study participants were randomly drawn from the same quota-representative participant pool and responded to the same items on the same measurement occasions. Results indicated a few differences between the study samples on the first measurement occasion (i.e., selection effects between studies). Further, we found statistical support for different trajectories in 21 aggregates/items. However, visual inspection of the trajectories suggested subtle differences between the studies at large. The results thus raise awareness that the trajectories of people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can differ between survey methods, especially when only a few measurement occasions are considered. Nevertheless, such differences might not be substantial over time.

Despite its effectiveness, CRT is underused, in part owing to concerns of tolerability and the need for integrated multidisciplinary care. We investigated factors associated with and the impact of treatment discontinuation in patients with MIBC treated with CRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the US Veterans Affairs’ national database, we identified patients with urothelial histology, MIBC (T2-4a/N0-3/M0) diagnosed between 2000 and 2018 and treated with definitive-intent CRT. The primary endpoint of discontinued radiation was evaluated in a multivariable logistic regression. Secondary endpoints of 30-day and 90-day mortality, overall mortality, and nonbladder cancer mortality were evaluated in multivariable models. RESULTS: Of 369 veterans with MIBC who underwent CRT, 30 patients (8.1%) did not complete radiation. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation included comorbidities or infections necessitating hospital admission (63.3%) and treatment intolerance or declining performance status (26.7%). In multivariable logistic regression, variables associated with radiation discontinuation were creatinine clearance ≤ 50 (odds ratio [OR], 3.93; 95% CI, 1.63-9.50; P = .002), incomplete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.15-8.63; P = .02), and nonpreferred chemotherapy (OR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.31-8.36; P = .01). In the cohort that discontinued radiation, 30-day mortality was 33.3% and 90-day mortality was 50.0%, with the majority of deaths attributed to nonbladder cancer causes. No patient or tumor variables were associated with either endpoint. In the cohort that completed radiation, 30-day mortality was 2.7% and 90-day mortality was 6.8%. In multivariable analysis, radiation discontinuation was associated with worse overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.48; 95% CI, 1.36-4.50; P = .003) and worse nonbladder cancer mortality (HR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.24-4.34; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: With a low rate of treatment discontinuation, CRT is an effective and feasible treatment option for the typically elderly and comorbid population of patients with MIBC.

Even though mate recognition plays a vital role in reproductive success, unusual amplexus with non-suitable mates (misdirected amplexus) have been reported to occur in the wild. Misdirected amplexus may decrease fitness thus likely having ecological and evolutionary consequences and their frequency might increase with human-induced changes in habitat. However, it is still unclear what promotes this unusual behavior and how widespread it is at spatial and phylogenetic scales. To fill this gap, we compiled a global database of misdirected amplexus events from literature and personal observations, with detailed information on environmental, geographical and behavioral aspects of reported events. Furthermore, we discuss its spatial, temporal and phylogenetic patterns. We provide a data set of 378 misdirected amplexus events for 156 amplectant species distributed across 69 genera and 18 families distributed in 52 countries in all continents except Antarctica. We collected data published or collected during the last 100 years, from 1920 to 2020, with information on the hour, month and year of the misdirected amplexus events. We recorded a total of 282 interspecific amplexus, 46 necrophiliac amplexus and 50 amplexus with objects or non-amphibian species, with USA and Brazil being the countries with the highest number of records. Misdirected amplexus did not occur equally in all zoogeographical realms, with most events occurring in the Neotropical and Nearctic realms. Interspecific amplexus was especially represented in the Neotropical and Mediterranean regions. Most events involved three species-rich globally-distributed families (Bufonidae, Ranidae and Hylidae) but misdirected amplexus was widespread in the phylogeny. We provide a comprehensive data set of misdirected amplexus for anurans, with our results showing that it occurs extensively in the wild and across the globe. This data set provides a baseline for understanding misdirected amplexus and their spatial, temporal and phylogenetic patterns. Likewise, this data set offers a baseline to test the environmental, ecological and ethological drivers behind this reproductive behavior and we encourage researchers to report detailed observations of misdirected amplexus to better understand this process and its potential costs at the individual and population levels.

Despite new social distancing guidelines and enhanced infection control procedures (e.g., masking, hand hygiene) being implemented since the beginning of COVID-19, little evidence indicates whether these changes have influenced the prevalence of CDI hospitalizations. This study aims to measure CDI prevalence before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a local cohort of U.S. Veterans. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of all Veterans presenting to the South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio, Texas from Jan 1, 2019 to Apr 30, 2021. Monthly laboratory confirmed CDI events were collected overall and categorized as the following: hospital-onset, healthcare facility-associated (HO-HCFA-CDI), community-onset, healthcare facility-associated CDI (CO-HCFA-CDI), and community-associated CDI (CA-CDI). Monthly confirmed COVID-19 cases were also collected. CDI prevalence was calculated as CDI events per 10,000 bed days of care (BDOC) and was compared between pre-pandemic (Jan 2019-Feb 2020) and pandemic (Mar 2020-Apr 2021) periods. Results A total of 285 CDI events, 920 COVID-19 cases, and 104,220 BDOC were included in this study. The overall CDI rate increased from 20.33 per 10,000 BDOC pre-pandemic to 34.51 per 10,000 during the pandemic (p< 0.0001). This was driven primarily by a rise in CO-HCFA-CDI rates (0.95 vs 2.52 per 10,000 BDOC;p< 0.0001) during the pandemic, followed by increases in CA-CDI (15.58 vs. 18.61 per 10,000 BDOC;p< 0.0001) and HO-HCFA-CDI (2.66 vs. 5.43 per 10,000 BDOC;p< 0.0001). Lastly, CDI rates have tripled since the start of the pandemic (March-Apr 2020) compared to the current year (March-Apr 2021) (14.69 vs. 43.76 per 10,000 BDOC). Conclusion Overall, CDI prevalence increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven mostly by an increase in CO-HCFA-CDI. As COVID-19 rates increased, CDI rates also increased, likely due to greater healthcare exposures and antibiotic use.

In this work we use time series of online search query frequencies to gain insights about the prevalence of COVID-19 in multiple countries. We first develop unsupervised modelling techniques based on associated symptom categories identified by the United Kingdom’s National Health Service and Public Health England. We then attempt to minimise an expected bias in these signals caused by public interest—as opposed to infections—using the proportion of news media coverage devoted to COVID-19 as a proxy indicator. Our analysis indicates that models based on online searches precede the reported confirmed cases and deaths by 16.7 (10.2–23.2) and 22.1 (17.4–26.9) days, respectively. We also investigate transfer learning techniques for mapping supervised models from countries where the spread of the disease has progressed extensively to countries that are in earlier phases of their respective epidemic curves. Furthermore, we compare time series of online search activity against confirmed COVID-19 cases or deaths jointly across multiple countries, uncovering interesting querying patterns, including the finding that rarer symptoms are better predictors than common ones.

msayw5t8,,WHO,Assessing Textbook Outcomes Following Liver Surgery for Primary Liver Cancer Over a 12-Year Time Period at Major Hepatobiliary Centers,,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of the current study was to comprehensively assess the change of practice in hepatobiliary surgery by determining the rates and the trends of textbook outcomes (TO) among patients undergoing surgery for primary liver cancer over time. METHODS: Patients undergoing curative-intent resection for primary liver malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) between 2005 and 2017 were analyzed using a large, international multi-institutional dataset. Rates of TO were assessed over time. Factors associated with achieving a TO and the impact of TO on long-term survival were examined. RESULTS: Among 1829 patients, 944 (51.6%) and 885 (48.4%) individuals underwent curative-intent resection for HCC and ICC, respectively. Over time, patients were older, more frequently had ASA class > 2, albumin-bilirubin grade 2/3, major vascular invasion and more frequently underwent major liver resection (all p < 0.05). Overall, a total of 1126 (62.0%) patients achieved a TO. No increasing trends in TO rates were noted over the years (ptrend = 0.90). In addition, there was no increasing trend in the TO rates among patients undergoing either major (ptrend = 0.39) or minor liver resection (ptrend = 0.63) over the study period. Achieving a TO was independently associated with 26% and 37% decreased hazards of death among ICC (HR 0.74, 95%CI 0.56-0.97) and HCC patients (HR 0.63, 95%CI 0.46-0.85), respectively. CONCLUSION: Approximately 6 in 10 patients undergoing surgery for primary liver tumors achieved a TO. While TO rates did not increase over time, TO was associated with better long-term outcomes following liver resection for both HCC and ICC.",2020,"Tsilimigras, Diamantis I; Sahara, Kota; Moris, Dimitrios; Mehta, Rittal; Paredes, Anghela Z; Ratti, Francesca; Marques, Hugo P; Soubrane, Olivier; Lam, Vincent; Poultsides, George A; Popescu, Irinel; Alexandrescu, Sorin; Martel, Guillaume; Workneh, Aklile; Guglielmi, Alfredo; Hugh, Tom; Aldrighetti, Luca; Weiss, Matthew; Bauer, Todd W; Maithel, Shishir K; Pulitano, Carlo; Shen, Feng; Koerkamp, Bas Groot; Endo, Itaru; Pawlik, Timothy M",Ann. surg. oncol,,#32388742,,,,,218561775.0

In view of the limited data on the risk of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and transfer of maternal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, the present study was undertaken. METHODS: A prospective study including 57 pregnant women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test (SARS-CoV-2-RNA+) and 59 neonates born to them was conducted at Pune, India. 39 viral RNA negative (SARS-CoV-2-RNA-negative) pregnant women and their 39 neonates were included as controls. Neonatal nasal swab/cord blood samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR for investigation of perinatal transmission. Transfer of maternal antibodies was studied using ELISA and PRNT. RESULTS: 10/57 SARS-CoV-2-RNA+ mothers were symptomatic. The duration between COVID-19 diagnosis and delivery was ≤ 7 days for 82.4%. Perinatal transmission as evidenced by viral RNA in the neonatal nasal swab/cord blood (CB) was 3.6%. IgG-anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 21.6%. Of the 39 neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-RNA-negative mothers, 20 (51%) and none, respectively, were positive for IgG-anti-SARS-CoV-2 and viral RNA. Preterm deliveries were higher in SARS-CoV-2-RNA+ (18.6%) than SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative (0/39) mothers (p < 0.005). Respiratory distress at birth (< 4 h) was higher among neonates of SARS-CoV-2-RNA+ (20/59, 33.9%) than SARS-CoV-2-RNA-negative mothers (3/39, 7.7%; p < 0.001). ~ 75% IgG-positives exhibited neutralization potential with mean PRNT titers of 42.4 ± 24 (SARS-CoV-2-RNA+) and 72.3 ± 46.7 (SARS-CoV-2 RNA-negative); higher in the latter (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The rate of perinatal transmission was low. Transfer of maternal antibodies was lower among SARS-CoV-2-RNA+ mothers than SARS-CoV-2-RNA-negative mothers with subclinical infection during pregnancy.

PURPOSE To determine whether contrast agent injection rate affects the degree of BPE in women undergoing breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 85 patients included in our prospective study randomly received 0.1 mmol/kg gadoteridol at a rate of 3 mL/s (group A; n = 46) or 2 mL/s (group B; n = 39). Breast MRI was performed at 3T using a standard protocol including postcontrast axial 3D GRE T1-weighted sequences. Two expert breast radiologists, blinded to clinical and radiological information, independently quantified BPE on early postcontrast subtracted images, assigning a score of 1-4. Mean comparison and regression analysis were performed to assess the influence of injection rate on BPE. RESULTS Groups were homogeneous in terms of age and final BI-RADS score. The mean BPE score was significantly lower among patients in group A (mean of two readers: 1.36 vs. 1.90; P < 0.01) with 70%-72% of patients assigned a BPE score of 1, compared with 36%-38% of patients in group B. Lower BPE scores were noted with the higher flow rate in subgroup analyses of both pre- and postmenopausal women, although the effect was more evident in premenopausal women. Regression analysis confirmed that the likelihood of a BPE 1 score was significantly increased with a higher flow rate (P < 0.01). The inter-reader agreement was excellent (0.83). CONCLUSION A higher contrast agent injection flow rate (3 mL/s) during breast MRI significantly reduces the degree of BPE, potentially allowing improved diagnostic accuracy by reducing false-positive and false-negative findings.",2021-07-29,"Marzocca, Flaminia; Moffa, Giuliana; Landi, Valerio Nispi; Panzironi, Giovanna; Kirchin, Miles A; Pediconi, Federica; Galati, Francesca",Acta radiologica,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/02841851211034038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323589/,236497413.0

However, they also raised numerous controversies because of their potential to endanger civil rights and privacy. Most studies on the acceptance of anti-COVID-19 tracking technologies did not include important social factors and did not examine the directionality between variables. We aimed to fill this gap in the present study. METHODS: We conducted a four-wave, representative longitudinal panel survey among Polish citizens on the relationship between acceptance of anti-COVID-19 tracking technologies and prosociality, national identification, and endorsement of individual liberty. Analyses were performed using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models. RESULTS: We observed bidirectional cross-lagged relationships between prosociality and acceptance of anti-COVID 19 tracking technologies, with a stronger path from prosociality to acceptance than the other way around. Endorsement of individual liberty predicted negative attitudes towards technologies and this relation was strengthened by perceived threat of future technological surveillance. We did not find a significant relationship between acceptance of technologies and national identification at the within-subject level. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to analyse dynamic within-person relationships between communal and individual aspects and acceptance of anti-COVID-19 surveillance technologies.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions globally to reduce the spread of the virus particularly since there have been no known cures or definitive treatment for the disease. One key non-pharmaceutical intervention was recommendation on wearing of face masks. There are reports of discomfort associated with wearing face mask including complaints of various skin rashes, acne and headaches which could hinder appropriate use of face masks. While the dermatological problems associated with face mask use have been comprehensively explored in high income countries, the data is sparse in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to determine the association between face mask use and development of acne vulgaris in our developing country setting. We subsequently determined risk factors for development of acne vulgaris such as duration of wearing face masks, type of face mask, and prior dermatological skin condition history. We aimed to also determine the potential of acne development secondary to face mask use to reducing predisposition to wearing face masks. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study conducted in within two local government areas of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Trained interviewers administered pre-tested questionnaires to 1316 consecutive consenting adult participants randomly approached for informed consent at various public locations. Information was inputted into MS Excel and analyzed using Epi-info. RESULTS: A total number of 1316 persons participated in this study with mean age 34.4 ±12.3 years and median age 35.5years. Male: female ratio was 1:1.41. New onset acne or worsening of acne following consistent wearing of face masks was reported by 323 (24.5%) of the 1316 participants in this study. The surgical face mask was the least likely to predispose to acne p<0.05. Compared with the surgical mask, persons using N95 face mask and cloth mask were 1.89 and 1.41 times more likely to have acne respectively. Persons with prior history of acne were more likely to develop new acne or experience worsening of acne following wearing of face mask OR 3.89, 95% CI 2.85, 5.33; p <0.05). The length of time of daily mask wearing was not significantly associated with occurrence of new onset acne or worsening of acne. Persons reporting prior histories of allergy were more likely to develop acne in this study (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.50, 2.88; p<0.05). In this study, 192 (59.4%) of those who reported having acne following face masks use responded they have a negative predisposition to wearing masks. CONCLUSION: Our finding of greater predisposition to development or worsening of acne following consistent use of face masks could have implications for the control strategy of COVID-19. The finding that the N95 face mask was more significantly associated with acne is of concern as this is the preferred face mask in healthcare settings. It is important for the medical community to investigate feasible and safe recommendations to help alleviate this condition.",2022-05-19,"Falodun, Olanrewaju; Medugu, Nubwa; Sabir, Laila; Jibril, Ihsan; Oyakhire, Nnebuogo; Adekeye, Adeola",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/292d7afd17af55e52d31f7bfda06cd78f51a8cc5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9119463.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35588427/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268224,248916394.0

A distribution dynamics approach is employed to reveal the trend and movement of disposable income per capita in each city before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the period when the COVID-19 was under the control. The findings reveal significant negative economic consequences of the COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 and show that most cities will converge to a level of disposable income which is much less than the Pre-COVID level if the COVID pandemic persists. Regional income inequality has intensified in the cities that have a longer duration of stringent social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and disappeared in the cities with policies of short duration. Disposable income per capita for urban residents recovered quickly when the transmission of coronavirus was effectively contained; and yet the impact of the pandemic on rural residents remains unresolved, if not intensified. This study demonstrates a significant divergence of the trend of disposable income across cities with different durations of social distancing policies and between urban and rural residents.

This review aimed to identify and compare at-home diagnostic tests that have been granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) and convey details about COVID-19 diagnostic tests, including regulatory information, pertinent to pharmacy practice. Methods Food and Drug Administration (FDA) online resources pertaining to COVID-19 tests, EUAs, and medical devices were consulted, as well as linked resources from the FDA’s webpages. Homepages of the 9 COVID-19 home tests with EUAs were comprehensively reviewed. PubMed literature searches were performed, most recently in May 2021, to locate literature about the identified home tests, as were searches of Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Literature Selection Studies were included if they were performed at home or were self-collected (or collected by a parent or guardian for patients under 18 years of age), and evaluated the positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) for the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results Limited data has been published for these home tests given that they are available through EUAs that do not require clinical trials. Fifteen studies were located from searching the literature, but only 2 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the home-tests' websites yielded a single study for each test with the 3 BinaxNow platforms using the same study for their EUAs. The 9 COVID-19 home tests with EUAs as of May 7, 2021 include 3 molecular tests and 6 antigen tests. These tests had similar performance based on positive percent agreement ranging from 83.5% to 97.4% and negative percent agreement ranging from 97% to 100%.

However, so far little is known about the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and side effects of COVID-19 vaccinations in patients with GSDII. METHODS: 169 Dutch Pompe patients are followed at the Erasmus MC Rotterdam. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients were requested to directly inform their physicians about SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infected patients were interviewed regularly by telephone until their symptoms subsided. Furthermore, all patients eligible for vaccination on 16-7-2021 (≥ 17 years, n = 122) were asked to complete a questionnaire. RESULTS: To date, fifteen patients (8.9% of our cohort) reported a SARS-CoV-2 infection (classic infantile Pompe disease n = 5, late onset n = 10). No patients were admitted to hospital or needed intensivation of ventilatory support. All patients made a recovery within 19 days. 41.8% of patients filled in our questionnaire regarding vaccination, of whom 98% were vaccinated.

Efficacy for energy psychology protocols has been established in more than 120 clinical trials, with meta-analyses showing strong effect sizes for PTSD, anxiety, and depression. The approach has been applied in the wake of natural and human-made disasters in more than 30 countries. Four tiers of energy psychology interventions following the establishment of safety, trust, and rapport are described, including (1) immediate relief/stabilization, (2) reducing limbic arousal to trauma-based triggers, (3) overcoming complex psychological difficulties, and (4) promoting optimal functioning. The first tier is most pertinent in psychological first aid immediately following a disaster, with the subsequent tiers progressively being introduced over time with complex stress reactions and chronic disorders. Advantages of adding the stimulation of acupuncture points to a conventional exposure approach are identified, and challenges around cultural sensitivities and unintended effects are discussed. After establishing a framework for introducing energy psychology in disaster relief efforts, reports from a sampling of settings are presented, based on interviews with this paper’s author. These include accounts of relief work with survivors of mass shootings, genocide, ethnic warfare, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of other reports from the field show a pattern of strong outcomes following the use of energy psychology in the days or weeks after a disaster and in the subsequent treatment of trauma-based psychological problems.

The University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy was approached to collaborate with DPH to create a certification program to meet the needs of this order. Objectives To utilize a unique, pharmacist-led practice model to increase the number of competent vaccinators to administer the COVID-19 vaccine, and to reduce vaccine hesitancy with timely vaccine information. Practice description A didactic and in-person training program was developed, with an evaluation completed by a vaccination-certified pharmacist. Additionally, faculty members, staff and students developed short videos answering questions about COVID-19 vaccines. Practice innovation We are aware of no other such programs utilizing pharmacists and pharmacy students as primary creators of training and certification of health care professionals to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. Evaluation Methods Success was gauged by the rapid increase in number of eligible health care professionals who completed the developed training program and became certified as COVID-19 vaccinators. When addressing vaccine hesitancy, success was defined by the number of videos created and number of views and likes the videos received. Results As of April 30, 2021, 1834 health care professionals registered to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 1195 (65%) participants completed the online training developed by pharmacists, and 872 participants (48%) attended pharmacist-led in-person competencies.

Population density scaling models revealed residual variance and skewness to be sensitive indicators of the dynamics of propagation. Lockdowns and schools reopening triggered increased variance indicative of outbreaks with local impact and country scale heterogeneity. University reopening and December holidays triggered reduced variance indicative of country scale homogenisation which reached a minimum in mid-January 2021. Homogeneous propagation was associated with better correspondence with normally distributed residuals while heterogeneous propagation was more consistent with skewed models. Skewness varied from strongly negative to strongly positive revealing an unappreciated feature of community propagation. Hot spots and super-spreading events are well understood descriptors of regional disease dynamics that would be expected to be associated with positively skewed distributions. Positively skewed behaviour was observed;however, negative skewness indicative of cold-spots and super-isolation dominated for approximately 8 months during the period of study. In contrast, death metrics showed near constant behaviour in scaling, variance, and skewness metrics over the full period with rural regions preferentially affected, an observation consistent with regional age demographics in England and Wales. Regional positions relative to density scaling laws were remarkably persistent after the first 5-9 days of the available data set. The determinants of this persistent behaviour probably precede the pandemic and remain unchanged.",2021,"Sutton, Jack Shahtahmassebi Golnaz Ribeiro Haroldo Hanley Quentin",,,#ppcovidwho-322324,,,,,235795407.0

We describe our year-long institutional experience with telemedicine in several general surgery clinics at an academic tertiary care center and examine the relationship between area-based socioeconomic measures and the likelihood of telemedicine participation. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of our outpatient telemedicine utilization among four subspecialty clinics (including two acute care and two elective surgery clinics). Geocoding was used to link patient visit data to area-based socioeconomic measures and a multivariable analysis was performed to examine the relationship between socioeconomic indicators and patient participation in telemedicine. RESULTS: While total outpatient visits per month reached a nadir in April 2020 (65% decrease in patient visits when compared to January 2020), there was a sharp increase in telemedicine utilization during the same month (38% of all visits compared to 0.8% of all visits in the month prior). Higher rates of telemedicine utilization were observed in the two elective surgery clinics (61% and 54%) compared to the two acute care surgery clinics (14% and 9%). A multivariable analysis demonstrated a borderline-significant linear trend (p = 0.07) between decreasing socioeconomic status and decreasing odds of telemedicine participation among elective surgery visits. A sensitivity analysis to examine the reliability of this trend showed similar results. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine has many patient-centered benefits, and this study demonstrates that for certain elective subspecialty clinics, telemedicine may be utilized as the preferred method for surgical consultations. However, to ensure the equitable adoption and advancement of telemedicine services, healthcare providers will need to focus on mitigating the socioeconomic barriers to telemedicine participation.",2022-03-24,"Zhu, Jay; Lois, Alex W.; Gitonga, Baraka; Chen-Meekin, Judy Y.; Williams, Estell J.; Khandelwal, Saurabh; Carrera Ceron, Rocio; Oelschlager, Brant K.; Wright, Andrew S.",Surg Endosc,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/075e1f7e9d6504e851695d19e7aac52e11bc4e97.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8945866.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-022-09186-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35332387/,247633676.0
6khpqu21,,WHO,The Unique Immunomodulatory Properties of MSC-Derived Exosomes in Organ Transplantation,,,,unk,"Methods for suppressing the host immune system over the long term and improving transplantation tolerance remain a primary issue in organ transplantation. Cell therapy is an emerging therapeutic strategy for immunomodulation after transplantation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult multipotent stem cells with wide differentiation potential and immunosuppressive properties, which are mostly used in regenerative medicine and immunomodulation. In addition, emerging research suggests that MSC-derived exosomes have the same therapeutic effects as MSCs in many diseases, while avoiding many of the risks associated with cell transplantation. Their unique immunomodulatory properties are particularly important in the immune system-overactive graft environment. In this paper, we review the effects of MSC-derived exosomes in the immune regulation mechanism after organ transplantation and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) from various perspectives, including immunosuppression, influencing factors, anti-inflammatory properties, mediation of tissue repair and regeneration, and the induction of immune tolerance. At present, the great potential of MSC-derived exosomes in immunotherapy has attracted a great deal of attention.

METHODS: An emulator of a CBCT‐based online ART system was used to simulate more than 300 treatments for 13 cervical and 15 rectal cancer patients. CBCT images were used to generate adaptive replans. To measure clinical resource cost, the six phases of the workflow were timed. To evaluate the dosimetric benefit, changes in dosimetric values were assessed. These included minimum dose (Dmin) and volume receiving 95% of prescription (V95%) for the planning target volume (PTV) and the clinical target volume (CTV), and maximum 2 cc's (D2cc) of the bladder, bowel, rectum, and sigmoid colon. RESULTS: The average duration of the workflow was 24.4 and 9.2 min for cervical and rectal cancer patients, respectively. A large proportion of time was dedicated to editing target contours (13.1 and 2.7 min, respectively). For cervical cancer patients, the replan changed the Dmin to the PTVs and CTVs for each fraction 0.25 and 0.25 Gy, respectively. The replan changed the V95% by 9.2 and 7.9%. The D2cc to the bladder, bowel, rectum, and sigmoid colon for each fraction changed −0.02, −0.08, −0.07, and −0.04 Gy, respectively. For rectal cancer patients, the replan changed the Dmin to the PTVs and CTVs for each fraction of 0.20 and 0.24 Gy, respectively. The replan changed the V95% by 4.1 and 1.5%. The D2cc to the bladder and bowel for each fraction changed 0.02 and −0.02 Gy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dosimetric benefits can be achieved with CBCT‐based online ART that is amenable to conventional appointment slots. The clinical significance of these benefits remains to be determined.

Precise estimates of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 could have led to better allocation of healthcare resources and more efficient targeted preventive measures, including insight into prioritizing how to best distribute a vaccination. We developed MLHO (pronounced as melo), an end-to-end Machine Learning framework that leverages iterative feature and algorithm selection to predict Health Outcomes. MLHO implements iterative sequential representation mining, and feature and model selection, for predicting patient-level risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. It bases this prediction on data from patients' past medical records (before their COVID-19 infection). MLHO's architecture enables a parallel and outcome-oriented model calibration, in which different statistical learning algorithms and vectors of features are simultaneously tested to improve prediction of health outcomes. Using clinical and demographic data from a large cohort of over 13,000 COVID-19-positive patients, we modeled the four adverse outcomes utilizing about 600 features representing patients' pre-COVID health records and demographics. The mean AUC ROC for mortality prediction was 0.91, while the prediction performance ranged between 0.80 and 0.81 for the ICU, hospitalization, and ventilation. We broadly describe the clusters of features that were utilized in modeling and their relative influence for predicting each outcome. Our results demonstrated that while demographic variables (namely age) are important predictors of adverse outcomes after a COVID-19 infection, the incorporation of the past clinical records are vital for a reliable prediction model.

Migrants are overrepresented in COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases, hospital admissions, intensive care treatment and death statistics in all countries with available data. A syndemic approach has been suggested to understand the excess burden in vulnerable populations. However, this has not stopped the unequal burden of disease in Norway. Initially, the disease was mainly imported by Norwegians returning from skiing holidays in the Alps, and the prevalence of infection among migrants in Norway, defined as people born abroad to foreign parents, was low. Later, confirmed cases in migrants increased and have remained stable at 35-50% - more than twice the proportion of the migrant population (15%). To change this pattern, we need to understand the complex mechanisms underlying inequities in health and their relative and multiplying impacts on disease inequalities and to test the effect of counterfactual policies in order to reduce inequalities in disease burden. Yet, the current paradigm in the field of migration and health research, that is, the theories, research methods and explanatory models commonly applied, fail to fully understand the differences in health outcomes between international migrants and the host population.

The potential social psychological impact of moralizing COVID‐19 mitigating practices on sustained behaviour change,10.1111/bjso.12399,PMC7361762,32584437.0,cc-by,"COVID‐19 mitigating practices such as ‘hand‐washing’, ‘social distancing’, or ‘social isolating’ are constructed as ‘moral imperatives’, required to avert harm to oneself and others. Adherence to COVID‐19 mitigating practices is presently high among the general public, and stringent lockdown measures supported by legal and policy intervention have facilitated this. In the coming months, however, as rules are being relaxed and individuals become less strict, and thus, the ambiguity in policy increases, the maintenance of recommended social distancing norms will rely on more informal social interactional processes. We argue that the moralization of these practices, twinned with relaxations of policy, may likely cause interactional tension between those individuals who do vs. those who do not uphold social distancing in the coming months: that is, derogation of those who adhere strictly to COVID‐19 mitigating practices and group polarization between ‘distancers’ and ‘non‐distancers’. In this paper, we explore how and why these processes might come to pass, their impact on an overall societal response to COVID‐19, and the need to factor such processes into decisions regarding how to lift restrictions.",2020-06-25,"Prosser, Annayah M.

However, the effects of different antiplatelet regimens on the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal injury have not been well studied, principally due to the lack of a low-risk sensitive and accurate detection system. Trial design. OPT-PEACE is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Gastrointestinal injury will be evaluated with the ANKON magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy system (AMCE), a minimally invasive approach for detecting mucosal lesions in the stomach, duodenum and small intestine. Patients without AMCE-detected gastrointestinal erosions, ulceration or bleeding after drug-eluting stent implantation are enrolled and treated with open-label aspirin (100mg/day) plus clopidogrel (75mg/day) for 6months. Thereafter, 480 event-free patients will undergo repeat AMCE and are randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive aspirin plus clopidogrel, aspirin plus placebo or clopidogrel plus placebo for an additional 6months. A final AMCE is performed at 12months. The primary endpoint is the incidence of gastric or intestinal mucosal lesions (erosions, ulceration or bleeding) within 12months after enrollment.

To date, there are no proven drugs or vaccines against this virus. Hence, the situation demands an urgent need to explore all potential therapeutic strategies that can be made available to prevent the disease progression and improve patient outcomes. In absence of clinically proven treatment guidelines, several repurposed drugs and investigational agents are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for their probable benefits in the treatment of COVID-19. These include antivirals (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir, and favipiravir), interferon, antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine), antiparasitic drugs (ivermectin and nitazoxanide), biologics (monoclonal antibodies and interleukin receptor antagonist), cellular therapies (mesenchymal stem cells and natural killer cells), convalescent plasma, and cytokine adsorber. Though several observational studies have claimed many of these agents to be effective based on their in vitro activities and extrapolated evidence from SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics, the currently available data remains inconclusive because of ill-defined patient selection criteria, small sample size, lack of concurrent controls, and use of intermediary outcomes instead of patient-relevant outcomes. Moreover, there is a need to clearly define the patient populations who warrant therapy and also the timing of initiation of treatment.

Our study aimed to investigate the rates of vaccination and the behaviors and attitudes against the vaccine in healthcare workers in Turkey. METHODS: This multicenter national survey is a descriptive study in which 12475 healthcare workers. Healthcare workers were asked to answer the questionnaire consisting of 12 questions via the survey. RESULTS: It was found that 6.7% of the healthcare workers regularly got vaccinated each year and that 55% had never had the influenza vaccine before. The biggest obstacle against getting vaccinated was determined as not believing in the necessity of the vaccine (53.1%). CONCLUSION: The rates of influenza vaccination in healthcare workers in Turkey are quite low. False knowledge and attitudes on the vaccine and disease are seen as the most important reasons to decline vaccination. It is important to detect reasons for anti-vaccination and set a course in order to increase the rates of vaccination.,2020,"Korkmaz, Nesibe; Nazik, Selçuk; Sule Gümüstakim, Raziye; Uzar, Hanife; Kul, Gülnur; Tosun, Selma; Torun, Ayse; Demirbakan, Hadiye; Seremet Keskin, Aysegül; Bahar Kaçmaz, Asiye; Aytaç Erdem, Hüseyin; Uysal, Serhat; Deniz Aliravci, Isil; Yesilyurt Sölen, Emine; Can, Hüseyin; Deniz, Mustafa; Demiray Gürbüz, Ebru; Kostakoglu, Ugur; Bölükbasi, Hilal",Int J Clin Pract,,#702260,,,,,221085238.0
sqem5jmn,,WHO,The Expanding Role of the COX Inhibitor/Opioid Receptor Agonist Combination in the Management of Pain,,,,unk,"Pain management in both outpatient and inpatient settings demands a multidisciplinary approach entailing medical, physical and psychological therapies. Among these, multimodal analgesic regimens stand out as a promising treatment options. Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor/opioid receptor agonist combinations hold great potential as effective pillars in the multimodal pain management by providing adequate analgesia with fewer safety risks due to COX inhibitors' opioid-sparing effect. Thus, these combinations, either freely or in fixed-dose formulation, offer a feasible option for the prescribing clinicians who seek to maximise therapeutic effect while simultaneously minimise adverse effects. The selection of the appropriate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and opioid agent at optimal doses is essential. It should be tailored to the patients' analgesic necessities, and his/her gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk, and potential concurrent aspirin use. Moreover, it should allow for addiction risk and the potential opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and constipation. To ensure an optimal match between the characteristics of the patient and the properties of the chosen medication, and to guide adequate and well-tolerated treatment decisions, it is of paramount importance to expand clinicians' knowledge of the currently available COX inhibitor/opioid receptor agonist combinations.

This has increased the need for remote memory clinics, we therefore review the literature, current practices and guidelines on organizing such remote memory clinics, focusing on assessment of cognition, function and other relevant measurements, proposing a novel pathway based on three levels of complexity: simple telephone or video-based interviews and testing using available tests (Level 1), digitized and validated methods based on standard pen-and-paper tests and scales (Level 2), and finally fully digitized cognitive batteries and remote measurement technologies (RMTs, Level 3). Pros and cons of these strategies are discussed. Remotely collected data negates the need for frail patients or carers to commute to clinic and offers valuable insights into progression over time, as well as treatment responses to therapeutic interventions, providing a more realistic and contextualized environment for data-collection. Notwithstanding several challenges related to internet access, computer skills, limited evidence base and regulatory and data protection issues, digital biomarkers collected remotely have significant potential for diagnosis and symptom management in older adults and we propose a framework and pathway for how technologies can be implemented to support remote memory clinics. These platforms are also well-placed for administration of digital cognitive training and other interventions. The individual, societal and public/private costs of COVID-19 are high and will continue to rise for some time but the challenges the pandemic has placed on memory services also provides an opportunity to embrace novel approaches.

METHOD: This was a retrospective observational study involving all adult patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection between June 30, 2020, and August 31, 2020. We compared patient-related factors and laboratory test results among all survivors vs nonsurvivors in our ICU with an aim to predict the factors which could predict increased risks of mortality among sick patients admitted to our ICU. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The overall ICU mortality in our ICU during the study period was 76.69% and less than 5% of the patients requiring mechanical ventilation within 1 day of admission, survived. More than half of the deaths (54.66%) occurred within 5 days of ICU admission. The best predictors for mortality based upon the Cox proportional hazard ratio are increasing age, neutrophilia, increased D-dimer, prolonged stay in ICU for 1–2 weeks, and those requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients with one or more comorbidities were noted to have 16% of higher risk of death than those without any comorbidity. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Rai DK, Sahay N, Lohani P.

The ID NOW COVID-19 assay is a simple, user-friendly, rapid molecular biology test based on nicking and extension amplification reaction (NEAR). Objectives : The aim of this study was to evaluate the ID NOW COVID-19 assay when used as a point-of-care test (POCT) in our Emergency Department (ED). Type of study : This prospective study enrolled 395 consecutive patients; paired nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each study participant. The first swab was tested with the ID NOW COVID-19 assay at the point-of-care by ED nurses. The second swab was diluted in viral transport medium (VTM) and sent to the clinical microbiology department for analysis by both the RT-PCR Simplexa test COVID-19 Direct assay as the study reference method, and the ID NOW COVID-19 assay performed in the laboratory. Results : Nasopharyngeal swabs directly tested with the ID NOW COVID-19 assay yielded a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 98.0%, 97.5%, 96.2% and 98.7%, respectively, in comparison with the RT-PCR study reference assay. When the ID NOW COVID-19 assay was performed in the laboratory using the VTM samples, the sensitivity decreased to 62.5% and the NPV to 79.7%. Three false negative test results were reported with the ID NOW COVID-19 assay when performed using undiluted swabs directly in the ED; these results were obtained from patients with elevated CT values (>30).

Concerns arose about the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on blood donations and potential significant blood transfusion needs in severely ill COVID‐19 patients. Data on blood usage in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients are scarce. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of blood component transfusions in the first 4 weeks of COVID‐19 ward admissions. The study period began 14 days before the first COVID‐19 cohort wards opened in our hospital in March 2020 and ended 28 days afterward. The number of patients and blood components transfused in the COVID‐19 wards was tabulated. Transfusion rates of each blood component were compared in COVID‐19 wards versus all other inpatient wards. RESULTS: COVID‐19 wards opened with seven suspected patients and after 4 weeks had 305 cumulative COVID‐19 admissions. Forty‐one of 305 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients (13.4%) received transfusions with 11.1% receiving red blood cells (RBCs), 1.6% platelets (PLTs), 1.0% plasma, and 1.0% cryoprecipitate (cryo). COVID‐19 wards had significantly lower transfusion rates compared to non‐COVID wards for RBCs (0.03 vs 0.08 units/patient‐day), PLTs (0.003 vs 0.033), and plasma (0.002 vs 0.018; all p < 0.0001). Cryo rates were similar (0.008 vs 0.009, p = 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized COVID‐19 patients required many fewer blood transfusions than other hospitalized patients.

This study investigates the effects of cycling training on neuromuscular fatigue and its peripheral contribution measured during and immediately after cycling exercise. METHODS Fourteen healthy men performed a fatigue test before a 9-week cycling program (PRE) and two tests after training: at the same absolute power output as PRE (POSTABS) and based on the post-training maximal aerobic power (POSTREL). Throughout the tests and at exhaustion (EXH), maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and peripheral fatigue were assessed in the quadriceps muscle by electrical nerve stimulation [single twitch (Pt); high-frequency doublet (Db100) and low-to-high-frequency ratio (Db10:100)]. RESULTS Time to EXH was longer in POSTABS than PRE (34 ± 5 vs. 27 ± 4 min, P < 0.001), and POSTREL tended to be longer than PRE (30 ± 6 min, P = 0.053). MVC and peripheral fatigue were overall less depressed in POSTABS than PRE at isotime. At EXH, MVC and Db10:100 were similarly reduced in all sessions (-37 to - 42% and - 30 to - 37%, respectively). Db100 tended to be less depressed in POSTABS than PRE (-40 ± 9 vs. - 48 ± 16%, P = 0.050) and in POSTREL than PRE (-39 ± 9%, P = 0.071). Pt decreased similarly in POSTABS and PRE (-52 ± 16 vs. - 54 ± 16%), but POSTREL tended to be less depressed than PRE (-48 ± 14%, P = 0.075). CONCLUSIONS This study confirms fatigue attenuation at isotime after training. Yet lower or similar fatigue at EXH indicates that, unlike previously suggested, fatigue tolerance may not be upregulated after 9 weeks of cycling training.",2018,"Mira, J; Aboodarda, S J; Floreani, M; Jaswal, R; Moon, S J; Amery, K; Rupp, T; Millet, Guillaume Y",European journal of applied physiology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-018-3950-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30121882/,52041170.0

Clinical settings are dynamic environments and the underlying data distributions characterising episodes can change with time (a phenomenon known as data drift), and so can the relationship between episode characteristics and associated clinical outcomes (so-called, concept drift). We demonstrate how explainable machine learning can be used to monitor data drift in a predictive model deployed within a hospital emergency department. We use the COVID-19 pandemic as an exemplar cause of data drift, which has brought a severe change in operational circumstances. We present a machine learning classifier trained using (pre-COVID-19) data, to identify patients at high risk of admission to hospital during an emergency department attendance. We evaluate our model's performance on attendances occurring pre-pandemic (AUROC 0.856 95%CI [0.852, 0.859]) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (AUROC 0.826 95%CI [0.814, 0.837]). We demonstrate two benefits of explainable machine learning (SHAP) for models deployed in healthcare settings: (1) By tracking the variation in a feature's SHAP value relative to its global importance, a complimentary measure of data drift is found which highlights the need to retrain a predictive model.

However, very little is known about teacher-related factors that affect students’ resilience. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to shed light on the relationships between teacher-level (affective and continuance organizational commitment, professional commitment, burnout, and job characteristics) and student-level variables (optimal educational climate, OEC: the needs of belonging, respect from others, autonomy, self-efficacy, and self-fulfillment), as OEC is viewed as a main source of students’ psychological resilience. A sample of 243 teachers and 1777 10th-grade students from 44 nationwide secondary schools in Israel participated in this study. The study included the entire population of this selected cohort. Using hierarchical linear model (HLM) coefficient models, we found two major factors that significantly predicted students’ OEC: teachers’ affective organizational commitment and teachers’ job characteristics. These findings indicate that schools may serve as a protective factor for students at risk, since schools can strengthen teachers’ affective abilities in order to ensure their students’ psychological resilience. These findings are especially important when working with students at risk, who tend to be exposed to a wider range of stress factors, both individually and academically. The importance of these relationships becomes even greater considering the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, which has had a significant global impact on many aspects, including students’ relationships with schools and teachers.",2021-04-03,"Freund, Anat; Zriker, Amit; Sapir, Zehava",Eur J Psychol Educ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d866a6faa832f0f31a3bdc9de4380700ae17c69a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8019305.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8019305/,

Mental health conditions are deteriorating, financial crises are increasing in prevalence, and the need to stay at home has resulted in the increased prevalence of domestic violence. In Bangladesh, where domestic violence is already prevalent, the lockdown period and stay-at-home orders could result in more opportunities and increased scope for perpetrators of domestic violence. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence and pattern of domestic violence during the initial COVID-19 lockdown period in Bangladesh and the perceptions of domestic violence survivors with regard to mental health care. METHODS: We conducted this cross-sectional web-based study among the Bangladeshi population and used a semistructured self-reported questionnaire to understand the patterns of domestic violence and perceptions on mental health care from August to September 2020. The questionnaire was disseminated on different organizational websites and social media pages (ie, those of organizations that provide mental health and domestic violence services). Data were analyzed by using IBM SPSS (version 22.0; IBM Corporation). RESULTS: We found that 36.8% (50/136) of respondents had faced domestic violence at some point in their lives; psychological abuse was the most common type of violence. However, the prevalence of the economical abuse domestic violence type increased after the COVID-19 lockdown was enforced. Although 96.3% (102/136) of the participants believed that domestic violence survivors need mental health support, only 25% (34/136) of the respondents had an idea about the mental health services that are available for domestic violence survivors in Bangladesh and how and where they could avail mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: Domestic violence is one of the most well-known stressors that have direct impacts on physical and mental health. However, the burden of domestic violence is often underreported, and its impact on mental health is neglected in Bangladesh. The burden of this problem has increased during the COVID-19 crisis, and the cry for mental health support is obvious in the country.

A Systematic Review.,10.1159/000522173,,35235938.0,unk,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to review the literature on the use of antifungal prophylaxis in penile prosthesis (PP) surgery and provide a summary on its efficacy as an adjunct to current prophylactic regimes in patients undergoing PP surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched up to May 2020. All included studies were analysed and the information extracted included author, title of study, year of publication, type of study, journal of publication, and main findings regarding post PP implantation fungal infections. RESULTS Nine relevant studies were included in this review, comprising retrospective single-centre studies and retrospective multicentre studies ranging from 2017 to 2020. Fungal infections were found responsible for 11.1% of all PP infections, with a greater risk in patients with diabetes, obesity, and from warmer climates. Current American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) prophylaxis guidelines do not incorporate the use of antifungals. Trials of antifungal prophylaxis regimes combined with antibiotic prophylaxis have demonstrated a reduction in PP fungal infections. CONCLUSIONS Fungal infections represent a significant proportion of implant infections and therefore antifungal prophylaxis is warranted. Future studies comparing the efficacy of traditional antibiotic prophylaxis as set out by AUA/EAU with novel prophylaxis regimes including the addition of an antifungal may provide more definitive guidance on this issue.
